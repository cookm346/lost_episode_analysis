Pilot (Part 1),1,1,J. J. Abrams,Jeffrey Lieber & J. J. Abrams & Damon Lindelof,Jack,2004-09-22,18.650000000000002,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_(Lost),"""Pilot"" is the two-part television pilot of the ABC television series Lost, with part 1 premiering on September 22, 2004, and part 2 one week later on September 29. Both parts were directed by J. J. Abrams, who co-wrote the script with Damon Lindelof. Jeffrey Lieber, who had been commissioned by ABC to write the first version of the script, earned a story credit. Filmed in Oahu, Hawaii, it was the most expensive pilot episode up to that time, costing between $10 and $14 million, largely due to the expense of purchasing, shipping, and dressing a decommissioned Lockheed 1011 to represent Flight 815's wreckage. Many changes were made during the casting process, including the selected actors, the characters' behaviors and fates. The pilot introduces the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815, who experience a plane crash and end up on a mysterious island. Three of the characters, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), are featured before the crash in flashbacks of their experiences on the plane as it breaks apart in mid-air; this narrative technique would be reused in almost every subsequent episode of the series. The Lost pilot is one of the most critically acclaimed television pilots of all time. Both parts earned high ratings, with Part 1 breaking the record for a pilot episode with 18.6 million viewers, and the episode would later win many awards and accolades. Jack Shephard awakens disoriented in a jungle, and follows a yellow Labrador retriever through the bamboo. He emerges on a beach, confronted by the wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815, a plane he was on that was travelling from Sydney to L.A. A surgeon, Jack administers medical aid to several survivors, assisting the pregnant Claire Littleton and giving CPR to an unconscious Rose Nadler. After the initial shock passes, Jack retreats to a quiet area to tend to his own injuries. He notices Kate Austen and asks her for assistance suturing a wound on his back. Sayid Jarrah organizes a clean-up group, while Hurley salvages food from the plane's galley and distributes them to survivors. Shannon Rutherford refuses chocolate offered by her stepbrother Boone Carlyle, believing rescue is imminent. A Korean man, Jin-Soo Kwon, tells his wife Sun that she should remain close to him at all times. After night falls, the survivors hear loud roaring noises and crashing trees in the jungle. The following morning, Jack and Kate set out to retrieve the plane's transceiver from its front section, which landed in the jungle. They are accompanied by Charlie Pace. The trio find it leaning against a tree, forcing them to climb up to reach the cockpit. Charlie disappears into the bathroom while Jack and Kate awaken the concussed pilot. He tells that the plane lost radio contact six hours after takeoff, whereupon it turned back for Fiji and hit wake turbulence. He estimates that they were a thousand miles off course before the crash, meaning that any rescuers would be looking in the wrong place. He tries using the transceiver, but cannot get a signal. Suddenly the strange roaring noise is heard again, and the pilot is seized by something outside the plane, prompting the trio to grab the transceiver and flee. During the escape, Charlie falls and Jack returns to help him while a terrified Kate runs on. After the unseen monster leaves, the three reunite and discover the pilot's mangled body suspended in a treetop. On the plane, Charlie runs by Jack while being called after by flight attendants. Turbulence shakes the plane, scaring Rose, who is sitting across from Jack. The two talk, and Rose mentions that her husband is in the bathroom. The turbulence gets worse until the plane starts to veer wildly, causing a man to hit the ceiling and oxygen masks to fall. Jack, Kate, and Charlie head back to the beach, where ten-year-old Walt discovers a pair of handcuffs, which he shows to his father, Michael. A man known only as ""Sawyer"" gets into a fistfight with Sayid, calling him a terrorist, but they're stopped by Jack and Michael. Jack determines that, with no prospects of immediate rescue, he has to try his best to treat the worst-injured survivor, an unconscious U.S. marshal with a piece of wreckage lodged in his side. He enlists Hurley's help. Sayid repairs the transceiver, but it has little remaining battery life and no signal. He explains that getting to higher ground will make it more likely to get a signal. He and Kate decide to go inland, alongside Charlie, Shannon, Boone, and Sawyer. Along the way, a polar bear emerges and charges the group. Sawyer shoots and kills it with a gun he took off the marshal, and Sayid accuses him of being the marshal's prisoner. Kate seizes the gun before the situation can escalate. Back at the beach, the marshal awakens and asks Jack, ""Where is she?"" As the inland team reaches higher ground, Sayid turns on the transceiver and gets a signal. However, it is being blocked by a looping transmission in French, which Shannon translates as ""I'm alone now, on the island alone. Please someone come. The others... they're dead. It killed them. It killed them all."" Since the transmission lasts 30 seconds and each iteration states the number of repeats thus far, Sayid calculates that it has been broadcasting for over 16 years. Anxious and under suspicion from the flight attendants, Charlie runs to the bathroom, where he locks himself in to snort heroin. As the turbulence hits, Charlie is slammed against the ceiling and he rushes out, strapping himself into a seat as the plane starts to go down. Kate is revealed to be the marshal's prisoner, wearing the handcuffs Walt found in the jungle. As the turbulence hits, the luggage compartment is shaken open and the marshal is knocked unconscious by a falling suitcase. Kate struggles to put on her oxygen mask due to the handcuffs, so she frees herself using the marshal's keys and puts his oxygen mask on him before attaching her own. The tail section of the plane breaks off and falls away. The series began development in the summer of 2003, when ABC senior vice president Thom Sherman decided to order from Spelling Television a script based on an idea of network president Lloyd Braun, who envisioned a series that was a cross between the novel Lord of the Flies, the movie Cast Away, the television series Gilligan's Island, and the popular reality show Survivor.[4] Braun had titled his concept Lost after a failed reality show that had broadcast in 2001.[5] Writer Jeffrey Lieber was contacted by Spelling's vice president of series development Ted Gold, and in September 2003 pitched to ABC the concepts for what he called Nowhere. Sherman approved the idea and hired Lieber to write a script, but Braun wound up rejecting Lieber's draft and subsequent rewrites.[6] In January 2004 Braun contacted J. J. Abrams, who developed the TV series Alias for ABC, to write a new pilot script, which would retain the title Lost.[7] Although initially hesitant, Abrams warmed up to the idea on the condition that the series would have a supernatural angle to it and he was assigned a writing partner.[8][9] ABC executive Heather Kadin sent him Damon Lindelof, who had long intended to meet Abrams as he wished to write for Alias.[10] Together, Abrams and Lindelof developed the characters and plot of Lost, along with creating a series ""bible"" which would store the major mythological ideas and plot points for an ideal five to six season run for the show.[11][12] Lindelof and Abrams worked between January 13 and 16, when Lindelof sent a 21–page outline to ABC's executives. A complete first draft of the pilot script was delivered on February 24, and the teleplay kept on being revised, with the final script arriving on April 19.[5] The development of the show was constrained by tight deadlines, as it had been commissioned late in the 2004 season's development cycle and Braun estimated that the whole process from writing to post-production took 6 to 8 weeks.[7] Despite the short schedule, the creative team remained flexible enough to modify or create characters to fit actors they wished to cast.[13] Though Abrams and Lindelof did not use Lieber's work as inspiration for their own, Lieber's request for arbitration at the Writer's Guild of America pointing out the similarities in both scripts earned him a story credit. Lieber would later say the series would drift much from his concepts in Nowhere, declaring Lost was ""more like Lord of the Rings than Lord of the Flies"".[6] Writer-producer Anthony Spinner later sued ABC on the accounts that he submitted a script titled ""L.O.S.T."" to the network in 1977, but the case was dismissed on the accounts that none of the people involved with Lost had read Spinner's work.[5] In the initial plans for the series, Jack was going to die midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was originally offered to Michael Keaton, but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After Matthew Fox's casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim.[14] The pilot wound up being played by Greg Grunberg, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects.[15] Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She was not going to be a fugitive, instead her husband was going to go to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's (L. Scott Caldwell) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. Lilly had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.[14] Matthew Fox, Dominic Monaghan and Jorge Garcia originally auditioned for the role of Sawyer, who at the time was supposed to be a suit-wearing city con man, but the role was given to Josh Holloway. Garcia was the first actor the producers knew they were going to cast. While the producers thought Garcia was spectacular, they did not think he fit in the role of Sawyer, so they created the Hurley character for him instead.[14] When Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked his southern accent and the edge he brought to the character (Holloway reportedly forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration). The producers knew he did not suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, but kept the same intelligence he originally had.[14] After appearing in The Lord of the Rings, Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles, like elves and pixies. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part that had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rocker that has been a big hit in the 1980s but now had a heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan's audition of Sawyer, they decided to cast him as Charlie and rewrote the script to make Charlie a young has-been instead.[14] When the producers were auditioning actors for roles in Lost, Harold Perrineau was in the area.[14] The producers called it a ""natural move"" to have him audition.[14] Although initially skeptical about the show, he took the role when Lost creator J. J. Abrams explained more about it.[14] A lot of children were seen for the role of Walt. They were narrowed down to the top three, with Malcolm David Kelley winning it, after the producers were impressed with his role in Antwone Fisher.[14] Abrams had worked with Terry O'Quinn previously on Alias, and was keen to work with him again. He explained to O'Quinn that although the role in the first episodes would be fairly small, the character will develop afterwards. O'Quinn took the role as he trusted Abrams. He was also the only character who did not have to officially audition for a part of a main character.[14] The producers were looking for someone who had a ""Paris Hilton quality"" to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women were auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace.[14] She was written to be an antipathetic character in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict.[16] Unlike many other characters of the first season, who were rewritten based on their actors, Boone was largely the same through production. He was originally going to be named Boone Anthony Markham V, going by the nickname, ""Five"". Ian Somerhalder was cast in the role, but he did not want to shoot a pilot; however, he jumped at the opportunity once he found out he would be working with Abrams.[14] Lost was planned to be a multi-cultural show with an international cast. The producers thought it was essential that an Australian was cast for the part of Claire, and the Oceanic 815 was leaving from Sydney. Emilie de Ravin was working in Edmonton, so was unable to go to the auditions, which were being held in Los Angeles. From a video she sent to the producers, they were able to tell that de Ravin had the youth and sweetness required for the role, but also looked as though she had some life experience.[14] Sayid was not in the original draft of the pilot episode, but executive consultant Jeff Pinkner had worked with Naveen Andrews on a short-lived ABC series called The Beast, and was keen to have him on Lost. The producers were surprised that Andrews was interested in the role. When they cast him, all Andrews was told was that Sayid was from Iraq and had been in the army.[14]Yunjin Kim originally auditioned for Kate. At her audition she told the producers that she spoke fluent Korean, having been raised in South Korea, where she had starred in several films. The producers were impressed with Kim's performance and wrote her the character of Sun, who was planned to be someone who could not speak English, but after examining her relationship with her husband, the audience would learn that she does in fact speak it. Daniel Dae Kim was cast in the role of Jin, Sun's husband. Dae Kim described his audition as a ""really interesting experience"". He found it especially hard as it was his first time acting in Korean, and he had not spoken in it regularly since being in high school, when he would talk to his parents.[14] Filming began on March 11, 2004, with soundstage shooting in Los Angeles for the scenes set inside the flight.[9] The primary location was the Hawaiian island of Oahu.[17] The wreckage of Flight 815 was made with a Lockheed L-1011 built in 1972 and previously used by Delta Air Lines until 1998, that after being purchased by ABC was broken up and sent to Hawaii by ship.[18] The purchasing, shipping, and dressing of the aircraft body accounted for most of the pilot's budget,[19] which at an estimated $10 to $14 million was the most expensive pilot episode up to that time.[20][21]Greenlighting such an expensive and risky project amidst ABC's low ratings eventually led Braun to be fired by The Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent company.[8] J. J. Abrams decided not to do aerial shots to avoid revealing too much of the island, and also because he felt that the different point of view could confuse audiences.[22] Filming wrapped on April 24, Lindelof's birthday.[23] Extensive usage of visual effects, particularly bluescreen, was used in the pilot. One effect in particular was re-shot just before part 2 was broadcast. The scene involving a stuffed polar bear was used for a pre-broadcast commercial and was freeze framed and mocked on the internet, prompting ABC to replace it with a CGI bear.[17] The pilot episode's world premiere was on July 24, 2004 at San Diego Comic-Con.[24] Part 1 had its first ABC broadcast on September 22, 2004, reaching a ratings record for a pilot episode, with 18.6 million viewers,[25] and on the following week, part 2 scored 10.5/17 on the Nielsen ratings, watched by 17 million viewers.[26] Both parts aired on the same night for its first UK broadcast on Channel 4, August 10, 2005, and it became an instant hit. It was the second most watched programme for Channel 4 for that week, with ratings of 6.75 million, second only to Big Brother.[27] Reviews were favorable upon release. IGN gave it a 10/10 score declaring that Lost ""delivers on every promise it makes to its audience.""[28] In IGN's 2008 series of ""Flashback Reviews"", IGN's Chris Carabott changed the scores; he gave part 1 a 9.5/10, saying that the show's mysteries ""would keep many of us captivated for the next four years""; he gave part 2 a 9/10, saying that ""It really is a roller coaster of emotion and that sense of dread that sets in here is brilliantly portrayed.""[29][30]Entertainment Weekly gave an 'A', stating that even non-science fiction and fantasy fans can like it,[31] and USA Today gave it 4 stars praising the cast.[32] The Futon Critic later chose the pilot as the fifth best TV episode of 2004.[33]TV Guide ranked the episode fifth on a list of the top 100 television episodes of all time.[34] For its 65th anniversary, TV Guide picked it as the second best episode of the 21st century.[35] At the 2005 Emmy Awards, Lost won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series. J. J. Abrams won an Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for the pilot, with Mary Jo Markey winning Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series and Michael Giacchino winning Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore). The show in general won Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series and Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series, while receiving additional nominations for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Writing for Drama Series.[36][37][38] Casting director April Webster won an Artios Award for her work in the pilot.[39] The first part of the pilot also won two Golden Reel Awards for Best Sound Editing in Television Short Form: Sound Effects & Foley and Dialogue & ADR,[40] and a VES Award for visual effects.[41] The episode was nominated for a Hugo Award and awards from the American Society of Cinematographers, Art Directors Guild and Directors Guild of America.[42][43][44][45] ""Pilot"", along with ""House of the Rising Sun"" and ""The Moth"", won a Prism Award for Charlie's drug storyline.[46][self-published source?]",10214,9.2

Abrams decided not to do aerial shots to avoid revealing too much of the island, and also because he felt that the different point of view could confuse audiences.[22] Filming wrapped on April 24, Lindelof's birthday.[23] Extensive usage of visual effects, particularly bluescreen, was used in the pilot. One effect in particular was re-shot just before part 2 was broadcast. The scene involving a stuffed polar bear was used for a pre-broadcast commercial and was freeze framed and mocked on the internet, prompting ABC to replace it with a CGI bear.[17] The pilot episode's world premiere was on July 24, 2004 at San Diego Comic-Con.[24] Part 1 had its first ABC broadcast on September 22, 2004, reaching a ratings record for a pilot episode, with 18.6 million viewers,[25] and on the following week, part 2 scored 10.5/17 on the Nielsen ratings, watched by 17 million viewers.[26] Both parts aired on the same night for its first UK broadcast on Channel 4, August 10, 2005, and it became an instant hit. It was the second most watched programme for Channel 4 for that week, with ratings of 6.75 million, second only to Big Brother.[27] Reviews were favorable upon release. IGN gave it a 10/10 score declaring that Lost ""delivers on every promise it makes to its audience.""[28] In IGN's 2008 series of ""Flashback Reviews"", IGN's Chris Carabott changed the scores; he gave part 1 a 9.5/10, saying that the show's mysteries ""would keep many of us captivated for the next four years""; he gave part 2 a 9/10, saying that ""It really is a roller coaster of emotion and that sense of dread that sets in here is brilliantly portrayed.""[29][30]Entertainment Weekly gave an 'A', stating that even non-science fiction and fantasy fans can like it,[31] and USA Today gave it 4 stars praising the cast.[32] The Futon Critic later chose the pilot as the fifth best TV episode of 2004.[33]TV Guide ranked the episode fifth on a list of the top 100 television episodes of all time.[34] For its 65th anniversary, TV Guide picked it as the second best episode of the 21st century.[35] At the 2005 Emmy Awards, Lost won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series. J. J. Abrams won an Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for the pilot, with Mary Jo Markey winning Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series and Michael Giacchino winning Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore). The show in general won Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series and Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series, while receiving additional nominations for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Writing for Drama Series.[36][37][38] Casting director April Webster won an Artios Award for her work in the pilot.[39] The first part of the pilot also won two Golden Reel Awards for Best Sound Editing in Television Short Form: Sound Effects & Foley and Dialogue & ADR,[40] and a VES Award for visual effects.[41] The episode was nominated for a Hugo Award and awards from the American Society of Cinematographers, Art Directors Guild and Directors Guild of America.[42][43][44][45] ""Pilot"", along with ""House of the Rising Sun"" and ""The Moth"", won a Prism Award for Charlie's drug storyline.[46][self-published source?]",7793,9.1
Tabula Rasa,1,3,Jack Bender,Damon Lindelof,Kate,2004-10-06,16.54,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_Rasa_(Lost),"""Tabula Rasa"" (Latin for ""blank slate"") is the third episode of the first season of Lost. It was directed by Jack Bender and written by Damon Lindelof. It first aired on October 6, 2004, on ABC. The character of Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is featured in the episode's flashbacks, showing how she got captured in Australia by the US Marshal Edward Mars (Fredric Lane). In the present day events, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) learn that Kate is a convict and fugitive while Jack is trying to save the marshal from the injuries he sustained during the Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash. The episode when broadcast in the United States was viewed by 16.54 million people and received mixed reviews from critics. It is the first episode to feature a 'Previously on Lost' segment, a clip shown at the beginning of each episode summarizing the recent events of the show. The episode receives its name from the philosophical idea of tabula rasa, meaning blank slate, a concept which is brought in one of the episode's final lines, when Jack tells Kate that all of the Flight 815 survivors should be allowed to restart with a new life. Kate, sleeping in an Australian barn, is awakened by the farmer, Ray Mullen. She introduces herself as ""Annie,"" a backpacking graduate, and Mullen gives her a job on the farm. When she later decides to leave, Ray offers her a ride to the train station. On the way, Kate notices a black car following them, and Ray reveals that he learned Kate is a fugitive, and has decided to deliver her to the authorities for the reward. As US Marshal Edward Mars closes in, Kate jerks the wheel and causes them to crash. Kate has a chance to flee, but stays to pull Ray from the burning vehicle, after which Mars captures her. Kate, Sayid, Charlie, Sawyer, Boone, and Shannon make camp as night falls. They decide not to tell the other survivors about the French transmission they heard on the transceiver, fearing that the news will cause panic among the other survivors. When an argument breaks out over the gun Sawyer took from Mars, the group agrees to have Kate keep it. Meanwhile, at the beach, Hurley sees Kate's mugshot, which Jack retrieved from Mars. The next day, the party returns. Kate secretly tells Jack about the distress signal. Mars's condition worsens, and while Jack searches the fuselage for antibiotics, Kate visits him in the makeshift medical tent. Mars awakens and grabs her by the throat before going into shock. Kate asks Jack to euthanize him, but Jack refuses, saying that he saw her mugshot and that he ""is not a murderer."" Elsewhere, Michael gets bothered by Walt talking with the enigmatic John Locke, and instructs him to stay away from the man. Mars's pain worsens, disturbing the survivors. Eventually he requests to see Kate alone, and asks her what she wanted to ask him on the plane before he was knocked unconscious during the crash. She says she wanted to make sure Ray got his reward for turning her in. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters, and a gunshot is heard. Jack is furious, but Sawyer asserts that Mars asked for it. However, Mars is still alive; Jack determines that Sawyer's shot missed his heart and pierced his lung. Jack suffocates Mars to put an end to his pain. The next day, Locke finds Walt's missing dog, Vincent, using a makeshift dog whistle. He brings Vincent to Michael, saying that as Walt's father, he should be the one to reunite them. Kate offers to tell Jack what her crime was. He declines, stating that their past lives are not important right now, and all of the survivors should be allowed to start again. During production of the pilot episode of Lost, creators J. J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof got along with a team of four writers—Javier Grillo-Marxuach, Paul Dini, Jennifer M. Johnson and Christian Taylor—to elaborate ideas on how the show could continue. The resulting ""Writer's Guide"" plus a positive reaction to the pilot made ABC pick up the show. The season one writing begun on May 2004, with the first episode being centered on Kate and following the guidelines of a self-contained script grounded in reality.[5] The script, credited to Lindelof, was finished by June.[6] It was the first episode directed by Jack Bender, who came to the show following an invitation by Abrams.[7] The episode is named ""Tabula Rasa"" after the Latin term meaning ""blank slate"", a concept attributed to the philosopher John Locke regarding how he believed humans are born without built-in mental content, then filled through their life experiences. Said concept is echoed by the final line of the episode, where Jack suggests the crash made the survivors into blank slates that could restart.[8] Both Joe Purdy's ""Wash Away (Reprise)"" and Patsy Cline's ""Leavin' on Your Mind"" are featured in this episode.[1][2]Josh Holloway, who portrays Sawyer, asked showrunner Carlton Cuse how Sawyer could have possibly missed in his attempt to euthanize the Marshal. Cuse notes that the writers thought this to be unlikely as well and discussed the concept of making Sawyer hyperopic, leading to him receiving a pair of glasses in ""Deus Ex Machina"".[9] This is the first episode of Lost to feature a ""Previously on Lost..."" introduction, which is a short recap of the most recent episodes to refresh the viewer's memory. The voice of the introduction was provided by Lloyd Braun, the ABC president who created the Lost pitch and had been fired during the pilot's production.[10] 16.54 million people tuned into this episode, ranking Lost as the ninth highest rating of the week.[11] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 7.7, praising the performances by the actors and how well characters were contrasted.[12]The TV Critic gave the episode a rating of 63/100, saying that its ""good intrigue from the writers because we want to know more about Kate and what she did"", while also stating that the ""lack of action may affect some who are hooked on 24's style of relentless developments and tension.""[13] Josh Wolk rated ""Tabula Rasa"" a B+, saying that ""Kate's story is intriguing, though she's still not quite believable as a fugitive badass.""[14] Robert Dougherty, author of Lost Episode Guide for Others: An Unofficial Anthology, said that the episode is ""important in establishing Kate's past life"", but that ""it isn't that important in the grand scheme of the Lost design.""[15] Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it called the episode a ""slight letdown in comparison to the pilot episode"", but arguing that ""most episodes fall short of the pilot's brilliance"" and that the use of flashbacks ""demonstrated [Lost] would be a character-based drama, a move that solidified its audience and let [its viewers] gradually know the many people that crash landed on the Island.""[16] Dan Kawa of Television Without Pity gave the episode a C+.[17]",6152,8.5
Walkabout,1,4,Jack Bender,David Fury,Locke,2004-10-13,18.16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkabout_(Lost),"""Walkabout"" is the fourth episode of the first season of the American drama television series Lost. The episode was directed by Jack Bender and written by David Fury. It first aired on ABC in the United States on October 13, 2004. The episode centers on the character of John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), who in flashbacks is revealed, in one of the first plot twists of the show, to be paralyzed from the waist down as he attempts to join a walkabout tour. On the present day events, Locke leads a hunting mission after the wild boar in the jungle as the food supplies of the Oceanic 815 survivors starts to shorten, while other survivors decide to burn the plane's fuselage. John Locke's backstory was conceived during the writing of the previous episode, ""Tabula Rasa"", and director Jack Bender decided to shoot the flashbacks in a way it enhanced the contrast between Locke's life before and after the crash. Problems involving the usage of real boar caused the producers to use computer-generated replacements and shots that suggested the animals' presence. ""Walkabout"" was watched by 18.16 million people and was reviewed positively, later being considered one of the show's best episodes. In the aftermath of the crash of Flight 815, John Locke awakens on the beach. He lies on the ground dazed for a few moments, wiggling his toes, before Jack calls him over to help him lift some wreckage off another survivor. Before the crash, Locke works a dull office job at a box company, where he is constantly belittled by his manager. He is planning on going on a walkabout in Australia, and has been training and studying for the trip for some time. He tells his plans to ""Helen,"" a woman he is supposedly in a relationship with, on the phone. He invites her to come on the walkabout with him, but Helen is in fact a phone sex operator to whom he's grown attached. She breaks off the conversation. Later, in Australia, one of the walkabout guides refuses to let Locke join, saying that he is too big of an insurance liability and had not properly informed them of his ""condition."" Locke insists that he's lived with his ""condition"" for four years and that this is his ""destiny,"" but the guide denies him , telling him to go home . It is then revealed that Locke is paralysed and cannot move his legs. Locke's first awakening on the Island is shown once more, revealing that when he woke up, he realized he could walk again. In the night, boars raid the body-filled fuselage of the wrecked plane, causing Jack to decide it should be burned. The next day, the survivors discover that their food supply has run out. Locke reveals his case of hunting knives and suggests that they hunt the boars. He sets out, accompanied by Michael and Kate. Kate is also seeking to set up a makeshift antenna in the jungle at the behest of Sayid, who hopes to use it to help triangulate the French transmission they picked up two days before. On the hunt, Michael is wounded by one of the boars. Kate helps him back to the beach while Locke presses on alone. Kate stops to climb a tree to place the antenna. However, before she can finish, she hears the sounds of the Monster, causing her to drop and break the equipment. The Monster heads for Locke, who stares at it in awe. Jack checks in on Rose Nadler, whose husband Bernard was in the tail section of the plane when it crashed. Rose asserts that he is alive, and that the people who were sitting in the tail likely also think that the people in the middle section are dead. Michael and Kate return to camp, and when she goes to tell Jack about Locke, Jack sees a man in a suit walk into the jungle. Jack chases after him and Kate follows, but instead of the mysterious figure, they find Locke, who's carrying a dead boar. That night, the fuselage is burned while Claire leads a memorial service for the dead using information she found in their passports, wallets, and luggage. Michael thanks Locke for hunting the boar and asks about the Monster, but Locke says that he did not see anything. Locke sees his wheelchair in the fire and smiles. While writing ""Tabula Rasa"", Damon Lindelof suggested that John Locke was in a wheelchair before going to the island, and while the rest of the writing team initially reacted with shock, they embraced the idea.[3] Lindelof wanted to embrace how ""what you think these people are is actually entirely different"", particularly since ""Tabula Rasa"" did not have many developments on Kate's backstory or why she was a fugitive, ""the Locke thing was a huge, big, reveal"".[4] To enhance the plot twist, all the flashbacks were shot in a way that disguised the presence of a wheelchair. In the scene where Locke is sitting in his bed, the paralysis is alluded by the electromedical nerve stimulation machine on his nightstand.[3] Lindelof also created a title for the episode, ""Lord of the Files"", a pun on Lord of the Flies and Locke's off-island occupation,[3] but the writers had already settled on ""Walkabout"".[5] To enhance the contrast between Locke's pre and post-crash life, director Jack Bender decided to put very little green and blue imagery in the flashbacks since the two colors are the most present in the island – being the jungle and the sea, respectively. The flashbacks were also shot with fixed cameras and wider lenses, ""Godfather-style"", to display the bleakness and sterility of Locke's world, and objects such as vending machines were put to remind of the ""things taken for granted"" that the castaways lack on the island. The flashback scenes featuring the day of the crash (see above 'Flashbacks' section above) were shot in a way that looked similar to the ones from the pilot episode, with the only shot from the pilot being the one where Jack requests Locke's assistance.[3] The scenes featuring boar were originally planned to use actual, domesticated animals. Since bringing domesticated boar from continental United States was expensive, and the animals available in Hawaii did not look like wild boar and rarely moved (the script required them to run in most scenes), the producers decided to use computer-generated boar instead, along with reaction shots from the actors and first-person sequences from the animals' point of view.[6] Instead of having a stunt double for Kate climbing the tree to place the antenna, Evangeline Lilly climbed the tree herself.[3] The Australian office that hosts the travel agency was filmed in an empty retail space in downtown Honolulu.[7] The episode is the first to feature Christian Shephard, but he is not portrayed by John Terry, who had not been cast yet. Late into writing, the producers decided to start setting up Sayid's backstory by introducing the pictures of Nadia. The scenes where Sayid looks at the photos were reshot when production of ""Solitary"" began and Andrea Gabriel was selected for the role, as the original pictures depicted a different actress.[3] Robert Dougherty writes that the episode possesses similar themes to ""Tabula Rasa"" – ""Walkabout"" is about ""being able to overcome the past and start over.""[8] It presents the dichotomy seen in much of the series; while Jack is a man of science, Locke is a man of faith.[9] Lindelof discussed that since Locke's healing was interpreted by the character as a religious experience, ""this character had been presented as this very sort of mystical figure moving forward"".[4] ""Walkabout"" received a 6.5 in the ages 18–49 demographic in the Nielsen ratings. The episode was watched by 18.16 million viewers,[10] an improvement of 1.6 million over the previous episode, ""Tabula Rasa"".[11] Reviews for the episode were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN in his ""flashback reviews"" gave ""Walkabout"" a 9.5/10, stating that ""Terry O'Quinn puts in an exceptional performance"", and commenting that showing Locke, who ""seemed like a confident and resourceful man with a mysterious and intriguing past"", to be a ""shell of a human being that is trying desperately to find his place in the world"" was ""a perfect juxtaposition of the differences between Locke off and on the island"". He also praised the supporting stories, claiming that ""Matthew Fox does a great job of playing the uneasy leader"" as Jack Shephard and that the Shannon-Charlie storyline ""does supply a little comic relief"".[12] Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it described the revelation that Locke was a paraplegic as being ""one of the show's signature moments"", and commented that the episode ""cemented the show as 'Must-See TV'"" and was ""a five-star effort.""[13] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a rating of 86/100, saying that ""Walkabout"" is an episode ""which seems to confirm all the promise of Lost’s pilot episodes"", and that the episode ""both enhances and completely changes how we perceive both Locke and Lost.""[14] Dan Kawa of Television Without Pity rated the episode as a 'B'.[15] Emily VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times said that 'Walkabout' is one of the most confident episodes a series has ever unveiled that early in its run"" and that the episode ""cemented more 'Lost' fans than just me, maybe more than any other episode.""[1] David Fury was nominated for an Emmy Award for ""Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series"" for writing this episode.[16] O'Quinn submitted his work in ""Walkabout"" and ""The Moth"" for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.[17] ""Walkabout"" comprises a significant chapter in Lost's history, persuading viewers of the series' ability to exist in the long term.[18] Viewers learned that the series would be full of surprises and mysteries,[9] and Lindelof even considered it ""a litmus test"" for viewers, particularly regarding how after a twist like Locke's past, ""the show isn't going to openly state what the implications of that are.""[4]Entertainment Weekly considered ""Walkabout"" to be the best episode of Season 1.[19] IGN ranked ""Walkabout"" as the fifth best Lost episode ever, behind ""The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham"", the Pilot, ""Through the Looking Glass"" and ""The Constant"".[20] The episode was also featured in similar lists by the Los Angeles Times,[21]TV Guide,[22]National Post,[23] and ABC2.[24] Jason Snell of The Incomparable thought similarly, saying ""Skippable? Are you kidding? If you could watch only one first-season episode of “Lost,” this might be it.""[25] The episode also shaped how O'Quinn viewed his character, as he was unaware that Locke would be paralyzed until reading the script. To the actor, ""Walkabout and the fifth season episode ""The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham"" are the two installments which ""sort of (summarize) [Locke's] whole trip.""[26]",6945,9.1
White Rabbit,1,5,Kevin Hooks,Christian Taylor,Jack,2004-10-20,16.82,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rabbit_(Lost),"""White Rabbit"" is the fifth episode of the first season of Lost. The episode was directed by Kevin Hooks and written by Christian Taylor. It first aired on October 20, 2004, on ABC. The episode is centered on the character of Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), with flashbacks revealing his past, including his childhood and his trip to Australia looking for his missing father Christian Shephard. In present-day events, the plane crash survivors begin to struggle as they realize they are running out of fresh water. While Jack tries to solve the conflicts, he starts seeing Christian in the jungle, and chases the hallucination of his dead father. The episode attracted an estimated 16.82 million live viewers. It received mostly positive reviews, and was listed as #49 on IGN's ranking of every episode of Lost. After the broadcast of ""White Rabbit"", ABC picked up Lost for a full season, adding an additional nine episodes to the thirteen that were already scheduled. A young Jack Shephard confronts a bully assaulting his friend. He gives Jack the chance to leave, but Jack decides to stay with his friend. When Jack's father, Christian Shephard, sees his son's beaten face, he tells him he should not be a hero because he ""doesn't have what it takes."" In September 2004 , Jack visits his mother, who tells him that Christian has abruptly left for Australia, and asks Jack to bring him back. He initially refuses, but she guilts him into doing it by reminding him of what he did to his father. In Sydney, Jack is informed by the manager of the hotel Christian was staying at that he has not been there for several days, following an incident at a bar. Jack finds alcohol, pills, and Christian's wallet in his room. In a morgue, Jack identifies Christian's body. The coroner tells him that his father suffered an alcohol-induced heart attack. Jack later argues with an Oceanic Airlines ticket agent, who says the documentation to put Christian's coffin aboard Flight 815 is incomplete. Jack, frustrated, explains that all the arrangements are set for the funeral once he arrives at LAX, and he needs to bury his father, because he needs it ""to be over."" Jack rescues Boone when Boone fails to save a drowning woman, Joanna. Later, Jack is approached by Hurley and Charlie about how to deal with their diminishing water supplies. At the same time, Boone confronts Jack for saving him and not Joanna, asking who made Jack their leader. Jack again sees the man in the suit from the previous episode and runs after him. Upon catching up, he recognizes the man as Christian before he disappears. Continuing to chase him, Jack trips and is left clinging to a branch over a cliff. Back at the beach, Claire faints from dehydration, and Charlie is unable to find the water rations. Locke volunteers to look for water in the jungle. While searching, he discovers Jack and rescues him. The two talk, and Jack says he does not want to be the leader because he ""doesn't have what it takes."" Locke advises him to pursue his ""hallucination"" of his father, explaining his belief that everything on the Island happens for a reason. At nightfall, Jack follows a sound he heard in the jungle, leading him to stumble upon a cave containing a spring of fresh water. He also finds some debris from the plane, including his father's coffin. He opens it, only to discover that it's empty, leading him to smash it up in frustration. Charlie catches Boone giving water to an unconscious Claire. Boone admits that he stole the water in an attempt to take responsibility for its rationing. A fight begins between him and some of the other survivors, but Jack returns and stops them. He gives a speech, telling them about the water he found and that they all need to cooperate to survive, because ""if we can't live together, we're going to die alone."" ""White Rabbit"" aired on October 20, 2004.[2] The episode was directed by Kevin Hooks and written by Christian Taylor.[3] Taylor declared the underlying message was of ""a man's journey to find out who he really is"", in how solving Jack's conflicted relationship with his father gave him an excuse to reinvent himself and was ""integrated into what Jack becomes in the context of the series"".[4]Showrunner Damon Lindelof was enthused about working with the episode, even if ""it did not end with a big shocking twist or surprise"" like predecessor ""Walkabout"". Lindelof was particularly positive about ""this great scene between Jack and Locke in the woods,""[5] which still influenced the characters' later discussions about faith, such as in the fourth-season finale ""There's No Place Like Home"".[6] In the scene when Jack is dangling from the cliff, Matthew Fox performs the stunt himself, as he considered that relying on stunt doubles ""always sort of inhibits the director's ability to shoot it in cool ways.""[4] Fox dangled from a thirty foot high cliff in front of a blue screen, that through digital extensions appeared to be hundreds of feet high. However, Fox's long time stunt actor, Steve Blalock, performed Jack's rolling down the mountain before grabbing the edge of the cliff, given Fox considered that ""there are some things that I'm not gonna be able to do"".[4] The episode is named after the White Rabbit from the tale Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, who leads the story's title character, Alice, deeper and deeper down a hole to a whimsical world called Wonderland, while meeting different characters. Just as Alice followed the White Rabbit deeper and deeper down the hole to Wonderland, Jack follows his father deeper and deeper into the jungle.[2]Geoff Heise, who shows Jack his dead father at the morgue, is also in the Pilot episode as a survivor. It is unclear why this is so, and whether or not his portrayal of two seemingly unrelated characters has any symbolism.[7] The episode marks the first appearance of actor John Terry, who plays Jack's father, Christian Shephard (the mysterious man who Jack chases in the jungle). In the previous episode, ""Walkabout"", Christian was played by a stand-in actor, as the character hadn't been cast yet; thus, only the back of his head was shown.[8] ""White Rabbit"" first aired in the United States on October 20, 2004.[2] An estimated 16.82 million viewers in America watched the episode on its first broadcast, and it finished second in its timeslot behind the 2004 Major League Baseball season playoffs.[9] Among adults aged 18 to 49, the episode earned a ratings share of 6.3/16, finishing in fourteenth place for the week.[10][11] Based upon the series' success, ABC picked up Lost for the full season soon after the broadcast of ""White Rabbit"", ordering another nine episodes beyond the thirteen it had already agreed upon.[12] The episode received mostly positive reviews. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, writing that ""The structure of 'White Rabbit' is kind of half-formed, in a way that strikes me as very similar to the structure of 'Tabula Rasa', but I think that feeling of everything having been tossed together at the last minute suits the episode in a way it didn’t the earlier one."" VanDerWerff also writes, ""the more I think about this episode, the more I admire it for taking away Jack’s agency.""[13]IGN reviewer Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.9/10, writing that it ""features one of the best flashbacks dedicated to Jack.""[14] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave ""White Rabbit"" a 72/100, praising on how the writers did another ""character heavy"" episode without ""trying to cram unnecessary action."" However, Pierson added that the cliff scene was clichéd, particularly as ""we don’t really believe that he will die, so it is an action movie scene which we probably didn’t leave.""[15] Ryan McGee of Zap2it described ""White Rabbit"" as ""a worthy successor to 'Walkabout,' and one of the stronger Jack-centric eps the show ever produced.""[16]Lost Episode Guide for Others: An Unofficial Anthology by Robert Dougherty says the episode is a must-see; it is ""our first in depth glimpse at Jack's character"".[17] Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+, complimenting the ""tantalizing peek"" into Jack's dysfunctional relationship with Christian, ""producing both juicy questions and eerie revelations"".[18] IGN listed ""White Rabbit"" 49th on their ranking of every episode of Lost, describing the ""live together, die alone"" speech as iconic.[19] A similar ranking of episodes by Emily VanDerWerff for the Los Angeles Times placed the episode at 82nd, feeling it was ""more notable for the things it introduces – like the Monster impersonating dead people"" than the plot.[20]",5617,8.4
House of the Rising Sun,1,6,Michael Zinberg,Javier Grillo-Marxuach,Sun,2004-10-27,16.830000000000002,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Rising_Sun_(Lost),"""House of the Rising Sun"" is the sixth episode of the first season of the American television series Lost. It centers on Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), who brutally attacks Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau); the survivors do not know why since Jin and his wife Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) only speak Korean. Meanwhile, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) proposes that the survivors move to the caves from the beach. The episode was the first to feature the backstory of Sun and Jin, and the former is shown in the episode's flashbacks. It was directed by Michael Zinberg and written by Javier Grillo-Marxuach. After being cast, Yunjin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim were nervous that their characters' relationship would foster negative perceptions of Korean people; the former felt that it was an outdated depiction which would influence a society little exposed to Korean culture. The actors discussed this with the series' producers, leading to the writing of ""House of the Rising Sun"" and the multifaceted depiction of their relationship. ""House of the Rising Sun"" first aired on October 27, 2004, on the American network ABC. An estimated 16.83 million viewers watched the episode on its first broadcast, and it earned a ratings share of 6.4/17, a slight increase from the previous episode. It received mainly positive reviews, with critics focusing on the revelations surrounding Jin and Sun's relationship. Sun is at a party, and is served champagne by a waiter, Jin. They soon develop a relationship, with Sun wanting to run away with Jin to America, but Jin insisting they honorably tell her father that they are seeing each other. Sun's father approves of their relationship as long as Jin takes a job working for him. One night after they're married, Jin returns home covered in someone else's blood. Sun is angry that he refuses to explain the blood to her and slaps him. He tells Sun that he does whatever her father tells him to do. A few years later, Sun secretly plots to leave Jin and her father, so she will be free to go wherever she wants. However, she does not go through with her plans after he expresses a loving gesture to her, and boards Flight 815 with her husband. It is Day 7, September 28, 2004, and Jack Shephard, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) go to the caves to gather water and investigate. Charlie steps on a beehive, and is told not to move by Locke or else the hive will snap. Charlie slaps at a bee on his face and shifts weight, causing the hive to snap and everyone to get stung. Later, at the caves, the survivors discover two long-decomposed skeletons, one male and one female, whom Locke dubs as ""Adam and Eve"". From the deterioration of their clothes, Jack estimates that they have been dead for at least 40–50 years, and finds a pouch on them containing two stones: one black, one white. (Their identity and origins are revealed in a later episode.) Locke and Charlie are clearing the wreckage at the caves and Locke tells Charlie that he recognizes him from a band Charlie is in, Drive Shaft. Charlie is happy that finally someone, other than Kate, is familiar with his musical background. Meanwhile, Sun is shocked to see Jin attack Michael on the beach for no apparent reason. James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) manage to subdue and handcuff Jin to the wreckage. Michael says the attack was racially motivated, which he later tells his son, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), is not true. Sun finds Michael alone, and in fluent English says, ""I need to talk to you."" Michael is shocked that she speaks English. Sun tells him that Jin is unaware of this, and explains that Jin angrily attacked Michael because of the watch he's wearing, which belongs to her father. Michael says he just found it in the wreckage and it's nothing important. Jack and Kate return to the beach and Jack starts talking to people about moving to the caves. The castaways argue whether to stay on the beach where a rescue party could see them (and keep the signal fire burning), or move to the caves, where there is more shelter and fresh water. The group splits into two camps accordingly: Jack, Locke, Charlie, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), Jin, Sun, Ethan Rom (William Mapother), Dr. Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), Doug, and Sullivan (Scott Paulin) move to the caves while Kate, Sawyer, Sayid, Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), Walt, Vincent (Madison), Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace), Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder), Rose Nadler (L. Scott Caldwell), Scott Jackson (Christian Bowman), and Steve Jenkins (Dustin Watchman) remain on the beach. At the caves, Locke tells Charlie that he knows Charlie is addicted to heroin. Locke says if Charlie gives up his drugs, the island will give him his guitar, which he misses deeply. Charlie hands over the heroin, Locke shows him where the guitar is, and Charlie is ecstatic. On the beach, Kate refuses to go with Jack to the caves. Michael menacingly approaches Jin with an axe, throws the watch at him, and shouts that the fight over the watch ""is ridiculous, because time doesn't matter on a damn island."" As Michael cuts Jin free of his handcuffs, one of the cuffs remains on his wrist, and Michael tells Jin to stay away from him and Walt. That night at the caves, Charlie plays his guitar as Jack returns with people from the beach. The episode ends with clips of the two groups, while Willie Nelson's 'Are You Sure' plays in the background. Both Yunjin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim were born in Korea but raised in the United States. Yunjin Kim initially auditioned for the role of Kate, but the producers liked her so much that they created an entirely new character, part of ""a couple [that's] alienated from the rest of the group because they can't communicate.""[2] A male Korean actor was sought out as Kim's co-star, with Dae Kim winning the part. He had moved from South Korea as a toddler and forgotten most of his Korean by the time he won the role of Jin; while Kim helped him with the language,[3][4] his accent reportedly sounded poor to native speakers.[5] The episode title is a reference to the song ""The House of the Rising Sun"", popularized by English rock group The Animals in 1964.[6] It was the first episode to reveal the backstory of Sun and Jin,[7] with the former being the focus of the episode's flashbacks.[8] Yunjin Kim felt the initial way in which Sun and Jin were portrayed represented an ""outdated"" depiction of a Korean relationship;[9] she and others in the Korean community worried that this would affect perceptions of Koreans, due to that race's lack of exposure in the American media. The two actors discussed ""potentially negative feedback"" with the producers early in the series' development,[10][11] and Yunjin Kim's fear led co-creator J. J. Abrams to ensure her character's story would be told.[10] Supervising producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who wrote ""House of the Rising Sun"", found it difficult to write the Jin-Sun storyline, as he did not speak Korean and had to get into a ""cultural headspace"" for which he had no personal reference.[12]Showrunner Damon Lindelof commented that given the script was written in English, only during the dailies the producers noticed that almost all of the episode would be subtitled, making them fear for ABC's reaction. Instead the network executives received it well, only being concerned about ""the complex inherent racial dynamics in the story where a Korean man was attacking a black man"".[13] From Dae Kim's perspective, Jin crashed on the island only to find himself in a ""worst-case scenario"" – he is ""among a bunch of strangers, he doesn't speak any English, and he's suspicious of people already.""[14] Kim thought it was important to convey Sun and Jin's first falling in love before showing their alienation from the other.[12] Grillo-Marxuach stressed the importance of the episode due to the discovery of the caves, which prompts the survivors to become ""full-time dwellers of the island.""[12] Referring to the episode's Jin-Sun and Locke-Charlie storylines, Grillo-Marxuach felt that the island was about being ""forced to confront your inner demons [and] work out things"" never addressed before.[12] Charlie's fear of bees is based on Grillo-Marxuach's life experience. Despite the character's phobia, Monaghan enjoyed working with the bees. The ones used in the episode were male drones, which meant they lacked stingers and were docile enough to easily handle. Monaghan's head and arms were covered in sticky honey to encourage the bees to land and stay on him during filming.[12] To simulate Jack and Kate's escape from the bees, the special effects team created ""CG bees"" and then added them in post-production.[12]Michael Zinberg directed and Sora Jung guest starred.[15] ""House of the Rising Sun"" first aired in the United States on October 27, 2004.[15] An estimated 16.83 million U.S. viewers watched the episode's premiere,[16] and it earned a ratings share of 6.4/17, a slight increase from the previous episode.[17] ""House of the Rising Sun"" finished in thirteenth place for the week among all the major networks.[18] The episode has received mostly positive reviews. In her 2006 work Finding Lost: The Unofficial Guide, Nikki Stafford called it ""an excellent episode, with a beautiful, mournful musical score.""[19] Robert Dougherty, author of the 2008 book Lost Episode Guide for Others: An Unofficial Anthology, deemed the ""smaller, character driven"" episode a ""must see"". He cited its showcase of Yunjin Kim and the revelations surrounding Jin and Sun's relationship, though Dougherty admitted some viewers might have found these minor characters uninteresting.[20] In 2008, Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly graded the episode with an A−. He described the main Jin-Sun storyline as ""delicate and gripping,"" and believed Sun's eventual decision to stay with her husband was as ""intriguing"" as the revelation that she could speak English. Snierson also praised the episode's humor and tension between the castaways' ""we're-gonna-be-rescued-any-minute- versus-we're-gonna-be-here-for-awhile"" mentalities.[21] Chris Carabott, writing for IGN in 2008, rated ""House of the Rising Sun"" with an 8 out of 10 – an indication of a ""great"" episode. He felt that Jin's situation deserved sympathy and was good fodder for future storylines, and also was pleased that the language barrier was somewhat resolved so early in the series with Sun's ability to speak English.[22] On a list ranking all the Lost episodes (except the finale), the Los Angeles Times ranked ""House of the Rising Sun"" 44 out of 110 episodes, explaining: ""Cutesy title aside, this first look into the Sun and Jin marriage proved the show was willing to try all kinds of different stories to be a success.""[23] ""House of the Rising Sun"", along with ""Pilot"" and ""The Moth"", won a Prism Award for Charlie's drug storyline.

The Moth,1,7,Jack Bender,Jennifer Johnson & Paul Dini,Charlie,2004-11-03,18.73,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moth_(Lost),"""The Moth"" is the seventh episode of the first season of Lost. The episode was directed by Jack Bender and written by Jennifer Johnson and Paul Dini. It first aired on November 3, 2004, on ABC. The character of Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. Charlie begins experiencing the effects of heroin withdrawal, while Jack becomes trapped in a cave. Meanwhile, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) attempt to triangulate the signal of the French woman's broadcast. Charlie's involvement in his band Drive Shaft is featured in the episode's flashbacks. ""The Moth"" was watched by 18.73 million people live, almost two million more than the previous episode. This episode marks the first time ""You All Everybody"" by Drive Shaft was sung in its entirety, as it had not been written yet in previous episodes. The episode received mixed-to-positive reviews, with some reviewers commenting that the episode was not of the same caliber as previous episodes. Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) tells a priest that he is going to quit his band because it has a bad influence on him. Soon after, his brother, Liam Pace (Neil Hopkins), tells Charlie that Drive Shaft has gotten a recording contract. Charlie doesn't want to sign the contract because he has qualms about the sex and drugs the band engages in. Liam talks him into signing, promising that Charlie can quit any time he's had enough. One evening at a show, Liam, to Charlie's frustration, starts singing the chorus to ""You All Everybody"", which is supposed to be sung by Charlie. Liam assures Charlie it won't happen again. Later, Charlie finds Liam high on heroin with groupies. Charlie kicks the groupies out, and tells Liam that he's done with the band. Liam says to Charlie that he, Liam, is Drive Shaft, and that nobody knows who the bass player (Charlie) is. He goes on to tell Charlie that without the band, Charlie is nothing, which spurs Charlie to use heroin for the first time. Years later, Charlie visits Liam's house in Australia and wants Liam to rejoin Drive Shaft for a comeback tour. Liam declines, but the band can't do the tour without him. He criticizes Charlie for still using drugs, and Charlie blames Liam for getting him started with drugs. Liam asks Charlie to stay with him for a few weeks, saying that Sydney has some good rehab programs and that he can get Charlie help. Charlie angrily leaves, saying he has a plane to catch. It is Day 8, September 29, 2004, and Charlie is suffering from heroin withdrawal since he voluntarily gave his heroin to John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) in the previous episode. After finding him, Charlie asks Locke for the heroin back, and Locke says that he'll give Charlie the drugs the third time he asks, because he wants Charlie to have the choice to quit. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) attempt to find where the French transmission is coming from, so they make a plan to turn on antennas at different points on the island in an attempt to triangulate the signal. At the caves, Charlie searches through Jack Shephard's (Matthew Fox) medicine supply for something to ease his heroin withdrawal. When Jack catches him with diazepam, Charlie claims he has a headache and was looking for aspirin. When Jack upsets Charlie by telling him to move his guitar, Charlie angrily shouts at him, causing the entrance of the cave they are in to collapse. Charlie manages to escape, but Jack is trapped inside. Using his construction experience, Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) leads the rescue attempt with Steve Jenkins (Christian Bowman) and Scott Jackson (Dustin Watchman). In the jungle, James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) goes to tell Kate (who is traveling to set up her antenna for the triangulation attempt) about Jack's predicament, but decides against it because he doesn't like Kate's hostile attitude. Charlie tells Locke about Jack's situation, but reveals the real reason for his going to Locke is to ask for his drugs a second time. Locke shows Charlie a moth cocoon, and explains that he could help the moth by slitting the cocoon and letting the moth free, but it would not survive because it would be too weak. Instead, the moth needs to struggle to break free. Nature and struggle make people stronger, Locke says, indicating to Charlie that he needs to fight through his suffering. Kate and Sawyer stay at the second triangulation point, while Sayid goes to the third. After learning of Jack's situation from Sawyer, Kate goes to help, leaving the job of turning on the signal to Sawyer. Charlie squeezes through an opening at the cave and finds Jack, but while doing so, the opening collapses and traps Charlie and Jack inside. Charlie hesitantly pops Jack's shoulder back into place at Jack's request. Jack correctly guesses that Charlie is suffering from withdrawal, and Charlie assures Jack he's okay. Kate desperately tries to dig them out along with the other castaways, while the two worry about losing oxygen. Charlie sees a moth which leads him to an opening and the pair dig out of the cave. Sayid sets off his bottle rocket to signal the antenna power up process. Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) sets off Boone's rocket from the beach, as Boone had gone to help rescue Jack, as does Sawyer from his location. Sayid turns on the transceiver, but before he is able to triangulate the signal, an unseen person knocks Sayid unconscious with a stick. Later Hurley brings Jack and Charlie water, he notes Charlie doesn't look well but Jack covers for him saying that he has the flu. Hurley tells him to get better and Charlie looks thankful to Jack. He sees Locke and asks him for his heroin and Locke gives it back. Charlie looks at it for a moment before tossing it into the fire, smiling. Locke tells Charlie he's proud of him and that he always knew he could do it. Charlie and Locke see a moth flying away. ""The Moth"" aired on November 3, 2004.[2] The episode was directed by Jack Bender and written by Jennifer Johnson and Paul Dini.[3] The church scene with Charlie and Liam at the church in Manchester was actually filmed on Honolulu, where the scenes on the Island are filmed. Monaghan says that he feels Charlie's black hoodie is a sort of ""security blanket"" that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels ""lost.""[4] The ""heroin"" that Charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar. Monaghan revealed this in an interview with Stuff magazine in October 2005, saying, ""[The heroin is] brown sugar. You get some really sweet boogers. You have to be careful not to snort too much of it, but it's happened a few times. You just find dessert up your nose couple of hours later.""[5] According to Monaghan, Drive Shaft is similar to Oasis, in that ""[Charlie's] first album was kind of like Oasis's first album: critically acclaimed, didn't sell big numbers, but in the industry, people gave it respect."" J.J Abrams and Damon Linelof told Monaghan that if he wanted to write the song that would be Charlie's ""one hit wonder"", they would consider using it in the show.[6] Monaghan wrote a song called ""Photos and Plans"" with a friend; Abrams and Lindelof liked the song, but it did not make it into Lost. The lyrics were inspired by an incident on The Phil Donahue Show, where Matt Reeves, who was close friends with producers Bryan Burk and Damon Lindelof, saw a female audience member yell out, ""You all everybody, acting like it's the stupid people wearing expensive clothes.""[7] The producers had an inside joke where they would say this quotation to each other. According to Burk, ""At one point, in a delirious stupor, we realized we had said it so many times that that had to be the song.""[6] In the Pilot, Monaghan's voice when he sang ""You All Everybody"" was based on ""when Prince puts on his female voice"", since the song had not been composed yet.[6] For ""The Moth"" the producers contacted Los Angeles-based singer Jude to write a full version. The song is sung by Chris Seefried, former lead singer of Gods Child and Joe 90.[6][8] ""The Moth"" first aired in the United States on November 3, 2004.[2] 18.73 million people in America watched the episode live.[9] The episode received generally mixed-to-positive reviews. Ryan McGee of Zap2it wrote that ""this episode wasn't a stinker by any measure, but after the run of early episodes, this is the first that really didn't hold its own when compared to the others"", adding that ""The moth imagery/metaphor just beats you down by episode's end, making you long for the more subtle writing the show has produced up until this point.""[10]The TV Critic gave the episode a 68/100, writing that it falls between being ""obvious and cheesy"" and ""beautifully paced and structured"".[11] Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, and shared his opinion that it is ""one of the more intensely metaphorical—and thus writerly—episodes of the series. The eponymous metaphor—delivered by Locke—is one of the series’ most blatant, and the moth’s consistent reappearance in the episode calls a lot of attention to the construction of the narrative.""[12] IGN staff rated ""The Moth"" as the 36th best episode in all of Lost, explaining, ""The moth of the episode's title appears both as a metaphorical and physical symbol of the struggle to find strength within yourself, as Locke explains to Charlie, and to take charge of your own life without relying on anyone else to do it for you.""[13] In a review focusing solely on ""The Moth"", Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9/10, writing that the episode ""does a great job of utilizing screen time for most the major characters on the show"", and that ""Locke's analogy of 'The Moth' in comparison to Charlie's situation perfectly encapsulates what many of the characters are going through on the island.""[14] In a ranking of all of Lost's episodes, Emily VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times placed ""The Moth"" at number 102, complimenting Monaghan and O'Quinn's acting, but criticizing the storyline for containing ""nonsensical drug abuse storytelling.""[15] ""The Moth"", along with ""Pilot"" and ""House of the Rising Sun"", won a PRISM Award for Charlie's drug storyline.[16]",5506,8.5
Confidence Man,1,8,Tucker Gates,Damon Lindelof,Sawyer,2004-11-10,18.439999999999998,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_Man_(Lost),"""Confidence Man"" is the eighth episode of the first season of Lost. The episode was directed by Tucker Gates and written by Damon Lindelof. It first aired on November 10, 2004, on ABC. The character of James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. Sawyer is accused of stealing Shannon Rutherford's (Maggie Grace) inhaler, and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) tortures him in an attempt to find out where it is. In the flashbacks, Sawyer's life before the crash is revealed, showing his scams as a confidence man. The episode was intended to make Sawyer look like less of a belligerent, as he had generally acted as the antagonist in previous episodes. It also set the stage for the love triangle between Kate, Sawyer, and Jack. The episode was first broadcast in the United States on November 10, 2004, earning 18.44 million viewers. It received mostly positive reviews, although a few reviewers discussed aspects of the episode that they felt did not blend in well with the rest of the episode and series.[citation needed] Sawyer is in bed with a young woman, Jessica (Kristin Richardson). After he declares his love for her, she realizes he is late for a meeting. As he rushes to leave, his briefcase falls open, revealing thousands of dollars in cash he claims she was not supposed to have seen. Sawyer then informs her that he is meeting someone to get money for an investment that will triple his cash in two weeks, and Jessica tells him that she will get additional money from her husband, David (Michael DeLuise), so that she and Sawyer can split the profit. Later, Sawyer is revealed to be a con artist in debt with a loan shark, Kilo (Billy Mayo), who demands his money back, plus fifty percent, by the next day. Sawyer goes to Jessica's house to finalize the deal, but reconsiders upon seeing a small boy (Jim Woitas), their son, emerge from another room. He suddenly calls off the con, drops his briefcase of money, and rushes out of their house. It is Day 9, September 30, 2004. On the beach, Sawyer catches Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) searching through his stash of items he salvaged from the crash, and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) attends to a wound on the head of Sayid. Sayid reports his failure in triangulating the distress signal, and the destruction of the transceiver by his attacker. Shannon brings a bloody Boone to the caves, where he explains to Jack that Sawyer beat him, and that his sister Shannon's asthma has become a problem. Many of the survivors become convinced that Sawyer is hoarding some inhalers from the wreck. Jack unsuccessfully demands the inhalers from Sawyer, and when Kate does the same, Sawyer says he will give up the inhaler if Kate kisses him. Kate calls his bluff and challenges him about the letter he often reads. Sawyer makes Kate read the letter aloud. The letter is addressed to ""Mr. Sawyer"" and explains that Mr. Sawyer had sex with the letter writer's mother and stole all of the letter writer's father's money, resulting in the father killing his wife and himself. As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) discuss the attack on Sayid, Locke suggests that Sawyer is the culprit, since he is doing well for himself on the island, hoarding other people's possessions, and also seems to dislike Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have trouble breathing due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval. Then with Jack's approval, Sayid ties Sawyer to a tree and tortures him for answers, revealing that he has tortured people before. Sawyer finally agrees to give up the inhalers, but only to Kate. He again says he will hand over the medication if she kisses him, which she reluctantly does, only to be told by him that he does not have the medication after all. Kate elbows Sawyer, and an enraged Sayid attacks him, stabbing him in the arm and hitting an artery. Jack arrives to stop the bleeding and save Sawyer's life. Sawyer wakes up the next day, October 1, 2004, with his arm bandaged up, while Kate looks on. She tells Sawyer that she knows the letter was written when Sawyer was a kid, and also works out that the letter wasn't written to Sawyer, but by him. He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that the letter was written to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family. He ended up becoming a con man himself, so he took the name Sawyer as an alias. He snatches the letter from Kate and tells her not to feel sorry for him and to leave. Despite pleas from Kate, Sayid sets off to explore the island's shoreline in self-imposed isolation, needing time to come to terms with his actions in torturing Sawyer, while Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) helps Shannon by making a eucalyptus salve to clear her bronchial passages. Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) convinces Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) to move to the caves, because they made a deal that if Charlie found peanut butter, she would move; Charlie shares an imaginary jar of peanut butter with her. Sawyer attempts to burn the letter he wrote, but he finds himself unable to go through with it. The episode was written to humanize Sawyer and set up the love triangle between him, Kate and Jack. Kate was meant to look at Sawyer in a new way, and, according to Lindelof, think, ""wow, this guy is not just a belligerent."" The episode also shows the moral ambiguity of some characters by revealing more of their personalities, with the ones introduced as protagonists doing things that are generally not viewed as protagonist-like– an example being Jack beating Sawyer and eventually asking Sayid to torture him; and an antagonistic character, Sawyer, proving not to be solely antagonist-like– an example being his backstory and flashback, which show that he is not exclusively evil. Lindelof explained that he wanted Sawyer to ""come out of his shell a little, and say to the audience, 'you're supposed to like this guy'"", further explaining, ""the root of him being an asshole is that these horrible things happened to him when he was a little kid, and he's really really angry.""[2] Sawyer and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) were the least-liked characters by viewers during the first few episodes, because, according to Lindelof, ""they were just really obnoxious, bad guys"". In later episodes, however, Sawyer and Jin changed to be more likable.[3] Towards the beginning of ""Confidence Man"", Sawyer is seen reading the novel Watership Down by Richard Adams (this is the book that caused Boone to think that Sawyer took Shannon's inhaler). The novel has numerous similarities to Lost, including ""letting go"", and building a society. Furthermore, the protagonists of Watership Down are rabbits – a recurring motif in Lost.[4] The episode ends with a montage of various characters performing different activities, featuring the song ""I Shall Not Walk Alone"", written by Ben Harper and performed by The Blind Boys of Alabama. One lyric from the song is, ""I just reach for mother Mary""; Sawyer's mother's name is Mary, and, according to reviewer Therese Odell from the Houston Chronicle, the lyric may be alluding to this.[5] Also, percussionist Ryan McKinnie of The Blind Boys of Alabama said of many members of the group's blindness, ""Our disability doesn’t have to be a handicap. It's not about what you can't do. It's about what you do. And what we do is sing good gospel music.""[6] This quotation is very similar to the oft-repeated quotation by many characters (especially Locke), ""Don't tell me what I can't do.""[7] ""Confidence Man"" first aired in the United States on November 10, 2004.[8] 18.44 million people in America watched the episode live,[9] a slight decrease from the previous episode, ""The Moth"", which garnered 18.73 million viewers.[10] The episode received mixed-to-positive reviews. Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode an 8.4/10 and called it ""a well-written, fascinating character piece that does an excellent job of bringing Sawyer into the spotlight"", later praising Josh Holloway's performance, writing that ""The success of this episode begins and ends with Josh Holloway. So far, we know that he's good at playing Sawyer: The Tough Guy, but now he has to sell a multilayered fragment of a human being who hates himself for becoming the man who destroyed his family. Holloway succeeds in creating a character that quickly unravels throughout the episode as his terrible secret is revealed.""[11] The website later ranked ""Confidence Man"" the 47th best episode of Lost, praising how it ""change[d] your entire perspective of a character"" in revealing how Sawyer came to be, which made a starting point for ""one of the greatest character arcs not only in Lost, but in all of modern television.""[12] Ryan McGee of Zap2it also had a positive review of the episode, writing that ""Confidence Man"" was ""A taut, tense, character-based episode which excelled on the Island and paid off in the flashback as well.""[13] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode an 82/100, praising Sawyer's performance, and writing that it was ""a very well written story"", but criticized the music montage at the end as being a crutch, explaining that ""It’s as if the directors can’t think of any other way to finish the show.""[14] Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave ""Confidence Man"" a B and wrote that ""Sawyer’s flashback is really well done"", but adds that ""Lost—at least at this point in its run—is not calibrated for one of its characters to torture another one. The episode simply doesn’t do enough to get us to the point where we can understand why this event was necessary, and why cooler heads couldn’t have prevailed.""[15] Emily VanDerWerff of The Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the 83rd best of Lost (excluding the finale), writing the episode is ""Not bad, but giving Sawyer a big, epic origin story feels kind of beside the point.""[16]",5593,8.7
Solitary,1,9,Greg Yaitanes,David Fury,Sayid,2004-11-17,17.64,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_(Lost),"""Solitary"" is the ninth episode of the first season of Lost, an American television drama series following the survivors of a plane crash stranded on a tropical island. The episode was directed by Greg Yaitanes and written by David Fury. It first aired on November 17, 2004, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) is captured by a mysterious French person, who is later revealed to be Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), a woman who shipwrecked on the island sixteen years before the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 and was alone for almost the entire time. At the island's camp, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) creates a golf course in an attempt to relieve the survivors' stress and worry. In flashbacks, Sayid meets a childhood friend, but must interrogate her. ""Solitary"" marked the introduction of mythology into Lost, and also solved the first mystery of the series: the origin of the transmission heard in part two of the pilot episode. It also introduced Danielle Rousseau, who would be in a total of 22 episodes through the show. The episode's initial broadcast in the United States attracted 17.64 million viewers. It has had a generally positive reception by critics. Sayid is torturing a Shiite prisoner suspected of bombing ""the Party's"" headquarters. When he steps outside, he sees a new prisoner who he recognizes. He is then instructed to torture her until she answers his questions. Sayid discovers that the woman is Nadia (Andrea Gabriel), a childhood friend. She reveals that she has been tortured before, and nothing Sayid does will persuade her to talk. Omar (Navid Negahban), Sayid's friend and superior officer, tells him to execute Nadia. Sayid cuffs Nadia and puts a hood over her head. When he and Nadia are alone he frees her and tells her how to escape. Omar finds them but Sayid fatally shoots him. Nadia thinks that Sayid will have to escape with her now, but he instead shoots himself in the leg and tells her to leave as reinforcements arrive, making it appear as if Nadia shot Sayid and the other officer to escape. On Day 12—October 3, 2004—Sayid finds a peculiar cable running out of the ocean and into the jungle. While following it, he is caught in a trap. Sayid is suspended upside down, held by a rope, and recites the Shahadah. A mysterious French woman (Mira Furlan) cuts him down and ties him to a bed in a bunker. She asks where Alex is, but when Sayid says he does not know, she uses batteries and a cable to shock him. Sayid tells his torturer about the plane crash and the French transmission the survivors heard when they first crashed on the island. The torturer then identifies herself as Danielle Rousseau, the woman who sent out the transmission. Danielle finds a picture of a woman among Sayid's possessions, and Sayid identifies the subject as Nadia. The next day, many survivors in the island's camp are stressed, including Sullivan (Scott Paulin), who is diagnosed with hives by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and his new hunting companion, Ethan Rom (William Mapother), give some newly found luggage to Hurley; he looks through it and finds golf clubs. The next morning, Hurley builds a golf course to improve morale amongst the survivors. Jack, Charlie, and Michael decide to join him, and eventually around twenty people, including Kate and Sawyer, arrive to participate. Rousseau asks Sayid about Nadia, and he says that she is dead because of him. Rousseau shows Sayid a broken music box given to her as a gift, and he tells her he can fix it. Rousseau reveals that she was part of a science team, and they were shipwrecked on the island about three days after leaving Tahiti. She identifies the ""Others"" as the carriers of a sickness that her companions caught, and says that the Others whisper in the jungle, although she has never seen them. Sayid does not believe her, but continues to fix the music box. After finishing the repairs, much to Rousseau's joy, he asks her to let him go. The duo hear a growl outside, and Rousseau pursues it, leaving Sayid alone. Sayid escapes from Rousseau's bunker while she is gone, grabbing a rifle, maps and notes she has made about the island. Rousseau finds him and they have a standoff; he tries to fire the rifle, but no bullet discharges. Rousseau says she removed the firing pin, and Robert, her former lover, made the same mistake before she killed him. She reveals that it was she who killed her team, aiming to stop the disease from reaching the outside world. Sayid talks Rousseau into letting him go, but, before leaving, asks about Alex. Rousseau says that Alex was her child. While trying to find his way back to camp, Sayid hears the whispering of which Rousseau had spoken. The episode was written by David Fury and directed by Greg Yaitanes.[3] According to series co-creator Damon Lindelof, discussion of both ""Solitary"" and the following episode, ""Raised by Another"", began in September 2004, when Lost debuted on television. The production team had fallen behind schedule, so Fury worked on ""Solitary"" while others went to a separate room to discuss ""Raised by Another"", with co-creator Carlton Cuse ""bouncing between the two universes"".[4] Although production codes generally go in ascending order, ""Solitary"" had production code 107, while ""Raised by Another"" had production code 106. This was because, despite the broadcast dates, ""Raised by Another"" was written before ""Solitary"". The episodes were edited so that Sayid would return at the end of ""Raised by Another"".[5] ""Solitary"" and ""Raised by Another"" were the first to orient the series in a ""weird and mythological"" direction, according to Lindelof.[6] In ""Solitary"", the series solved its first mystery by revealing the origin of the French voice heard earlier. This reveal occurred despite the network encouraging the producers to wait until the finale to show Rousseau.[4] The episode was the first to feature flashbacks with Sayid, an Arab character.[7] The producers knew they had to tread carefully with the character due to possible prejudices against Arabs. The actor, Naveen Andrews, said, ""we were all pretty nervous, in the sense that we all felt we owed a real obligation, not just to Iraqis but the entire Arab world about how this character would be played.""[8] In an early draft of ""Solitary"", Rousseau told Sayid that she and her research team were studying time. When ABC saw this draft, they asked the producers to remove this line, explaining that they did not want the show to venture into science fiction during the first season.[9] The character of Sullivan, to whose medical woes Jack tended, was created to make the rest of the survivors think that Rousseau's team was killed by an illness.[9] The idea for Hurley's golf course came from script coordinator Brent Fletcher; it was based on a miniature golf course he created in the offices for the television show Angel.[9] ""Solitary"" first aired in the United States on November 17, 2004.[10] An estimated 17.64 million American viewers watched the episode on ABC,[11] a decrease from 18.44 million viewers in the previous episode, ""Confidence Man"".[12] In a review of the episode, Chris Carabott of IGN commented that Rousseau appeared to be more emotionally fragile than in later seasons, and was like a ""loose cannon"". Carabott found that as the series progressed and the mystery around the character was lessened, Rousseau was unable to deliver the same impact she made in her first appearance.[2] Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club commended Mira Furlan's performance, writing, ""[Rousseau is] an unreliable historian of the island in the best way. Rousseau has been on this island for over sixteen years, and it shows in her ramshackle bunker, her unkempt appearance, and the fact she tortures Sayid for information before even asking him a cursory question about his identity.""[13] In a ranking of every episode of Lost (excluding the finale) for the Los Angeles Times, Emily VanDerWerff ranked ""Solitary"" as the show's 45th best episode, and called it underrated.[14] In a similar list, IGN staff ranked the episode as Lost's 51st best, and observed that ""despite [Sayid's] dark past, it was hard not to love the character even more after this episode.""[15]MTV ranked the episode the 32nd best of the series.[16] Writing for Zap2it in 2008, Ryan McGee said he particularly enjoyed the episode and deemed it one of his top ten favorite episodes that had aired up to that point. McGee explained that ""Solitary"" contains ""a lot of enclosed encounters between two people, set against a gorgeously shot B story that warms the heart.""[17]",5261,8.5
Raised by Another,1,10,Marita Grabiak,Lynne E. Litt,Claire,2004-12-01,17.150000000000002,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raised_by_Another,"""Raised by Another"" is the tenth episode of the first season of the American drama series Lost. It first aired on December 1, 2004, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Directed by Marita Grabiak and written by Lynne E. Litt, the episode was the first to reveal the backstory of Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin). It also represented a shift from previous Lost backstories by being one of the first to emphasise the series' mythology – a decision that made the network nervous at the time. In this episode, flashbacks depict the story behind Claire's pregnancy. Rejected by her boyfriend when he refused to raise their child, Claire decides to go to an adoption agency out of a belief that she will struggle to raise it alone. Claire visits a psychic (Nick Jameson) who warns her of a dangerous future for her unborn child if she does not raise it. In the present, Claire experiences terrifying nightmares and begins to suspect that somebody is trying to harm her unborn child. In response, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) decides to start a census of all of the survivors. ""Raised by Another"" marks the revelation that Ethan (William Mapother) is not among the remaining survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 and is instead an outsider, revealed to be one of the Others alluded to in the previous episode. The final scene involving Claire and Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) being approached by Ethan was lauded by television commentators. Claire Littleton takes a pregnancy test with the assistance of her boyfriend, Thomas (Keir O'Donnell), and it is positive. Thomas reassures her that everything will be fine and that they will be good parents. Claire goes to a psychic, Richard Malkin (Nick Jameson), who knows she is pregnant. After touching her hand, he has a supposed vision and becomes upset, but refuses to tell Claire what he ""saw"". Later, Thomas tells Claire he is leaving, saying that he is not ready for the responsibility of a child. Claire returns to the psychic and asks him for another reading. Richard knows that Thomas left her and says that Claire must raise the baby, as, if anyone else parents it, the baby will be in danger. Though the psychic repeatedly tells Claire not to give the child away, she tells him that she's going to an adoptive services agency. Claire is about to sign papers so that a couple can adopt her baby, but none of the pens she tries work. After Claire thinks, she leaves the adoption agency and goes to the psychic. He gives her $6,000 and a ticket on Oceanic Flight 815, explaining that a couple in Los Angeles would adopt the baby and give her an additional $6,000. Initially Claire is skeptical about giving her child to complete strangers in Los Angeles, but Richard assures her that ""they're not strangers"" and that they are ""good people."" Even though Claire initially finds this change of heart suspicious, she accepts. It is Day 15, October 6, 2004, and Claire wakes up from nightmares two nights in a row, screaming. In the first, Claire wakes to find herself no longer pregnant, as she walks into the forest and encounters John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) at a table, playing cards. She asks him why he is there, but Locke interrupts, telling her ""He was your responsibility, but you gave him away, Claire. Everyone pays the price now."" Locke looks up with one white and one black eye. She hears crying and finds a baby crib. After unfolding several layers of material she dips her hands into a pool of blood and then wakes screaming; she has injured her hands by digging her nails deeply into her palms. In the second dream, someone holds Claire down and injects something into her stomach, though she has no wound. Claire's attack persuades Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) to take a census of the survivors to have a clear idea of who actually resides on the island. The next day, while conducting his census, Hurley talks to Ethan Rom (William Mapother), who seems concerned about giving his information to Hurley. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) suggests to Claire that she imagined the attack and offers her a sedative. Claire becomes upset that Jack does not believe her, deciding to leave the caves and move back to the beach. Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) tells Hurley that James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) has the flight manifest from the plane, and that could help him take the census. Sawyer uncharacteristically gives it to Hurley without any objection. While Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) tries to help Claire move back to the beach, she starts having contractions. Charlie says he can deliver the baby, but after he accidentally confesses that he is a recovering drug addict, she yells at him to get Jack, which leaves her alone in the jungle. Charlie finds Ethan and tells him that Claire is in labor and to get Jack. Charlie goes back to comfort Claire, who tells him the story about the psychic. Charlie suggests that the psychic knew the flight was going to crash, and this was his way of forcing Claire to raise the baby by herself. A badly wounded Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) returns to camp and tells the others about Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), and that other people live on the island, besides the plane survivors. Locke looks on from the shadows with his arms crossed. Hurley reveals to Jack that one of the survivors is not listed on the flight manifest, which means that someone was already on the island when the plane crashed. Claire's contractions begin to stop. Claire and Charlie are then met by Ethan, who looks at them ominously. ""Raised by Another"" was written by consulting producer Lynne E. Litt.[2] It was the first to feature Claire's backstory before she arrived on the island.[3] The episode's story was developed in September 2004, around the time that the series premiered on television. Series co-creator Damon Lindelof later recalled that when the network realized Lost was going to be popular, they read the plans for ""Raised by Another"" and warned the writers not to endanger its success.[4] The first season contained flashbacks of main characters to develop their back stories to viewers. This approach was changed for ""Raised by Another"", as the writers instead approached Claire's flashbacks as a way to reveal the island's mythology. According to Lindelof, ""the network got really nervous, because that was a deep dive into mythology.""[5] The episode's director, Marita Grabiak, had worked with Lost co-creator J. J. Abrams on the television series Alias. She met with him to discuss the episode's tone, and they also regularly talked over the phone once filming began. She explained, ""He was involved in every aspect of the outline, the first draft, the second draft, just constant phone calls back and forth because, basically the challenge of that show was making the schedule.""[6] Emilie de Ravin, an Australian actress, originally auditioned for the role of Shannon, speaking her dialogue with an American accent. Instead, they offered her the part of Claire; she accepted without reading the script, assuming it would just be a recurring role.[7] While de Ravin had never been pregnant, she was able to learn of the experience from her two older sisters.[8] She found the hot weather conditions in Hawaii difficult, later saying that ""in many ways, the filming is actually like the drama. You endure the muggiest weather in the rainforest... You're really exposed to the elements.""[9] The actress admitted being ""creeped out"" by the premise of ""Raised by Another"", in which a psychic tricks Claire by sending her to the island to raise her baby.[10] The build up to Ethan's reveal is exceptionally handled, with Jack doubting the authenticity of Claire's claims and Hurley creating a list of all the survivors so that they can keep track of who is who. The suspense builds and the final reveal is more than worth the wait as Sayid finally returns to the camp to inform the survivors that they are not alone. This occurs simultaneously with Hurley's discovery that Ethan Rom wasn't on the plane. It's a great conclusion that sets up the next episode and the latter half of the season perfectly. Chris Carabott, IGN[11] ""Raised by Another"" first aired on December 1, 2004 in the United States.[2] An estimated 17.15 million viewers watched the episode live,[12] meaning it finished in first place that night[13] and in tenth place for the week among all major American networks.[14] Among 18- to 49-year-old viewers, the episode earned a rating of 5.9/16 making it the eleventh highest of the week among that age demographic.[13] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Whitney Pastorek called it ""a decent episode made much, much better by its absolutely bloodcurdling final moments.""[15] Chris Carabott of IGN wrote in 2008 that while the episode was not the best of the first season, it was ""noteworthy for its memorable reveal of the show's first Other.""[11] He praised the episode's suspenseful climax, with Ethan's revelation appearing alongside Sayid and Hurley warning them they are not alone. De Ravin's performance was seen as another highlight.[11]Zap2it columnist Ryan McGee, also writing in 2008, praised the ""stellar"" episode for showing the first real antagonist of the series. McGee felt that Ethan's reveal helped Lost turn ""sharply in introducing an on-Island, human threat for [the] survivors."" He concluded that it was among the top five best episodes of the first season.[16] Emily VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times rated the episode 58th of all Lost episodes (apart from the series finale) and commented positively on the ""nicely spooky flashback to the psychic who was way too into getting her on that plane to L.A.""[3] Rewatching the episode in 2014, Myles McNutt stated that ""Solitary"" and ""Raised by Another"" felt like ""the first that go all-in on Lost as a serialized mystery,"" in part as Claire's story is the first to reveal a character's destined voyage to the island in the form of flashbacks.[17] In 2014, MTV columnist Josh Wigler ranked it as the 76th-best Lost episode, stating that ""Ethan Rom’s episode-closing reveal is one of the chilliest moments of early Lost.""[18]",5346,8.7
All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues,1,11,Stephen Williams,Javier Grillo-Marxuach,Jack,2004-12-08,18.88,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_Best_Cowboys_Have_Daddy_Issues,"""All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues"" is the eleventh episode of the American drama series first season of Lost. The episode was directed by Stephen Williams and written by Javier Grillo-Marxuach. It first aired on December 8, 2004, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). In the episode, flashbacks reveal Jack Shephard being responsible for his father's dismissal from a hospital after performing surgery while drunk. In the present, Jack and a team go searching for two fellow plane crash survivors after they are kidnapped by somebody who was not listed in the passenger manifest. The flashbacks were inspired by Grillo-Marxuach's background as the son of a doctor, and the episode in general went through several changes in the writing stage, one of them being the creation of two new characters who help look for the missing survivors, who were then scrapped in favor of including regular character Boone Carlyle. ""All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues"" was watched by 18.88 million Americans and was met with positive reviews from critics, with several reviewers commending the scene in which Jack saves Charlie Pace. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) operates on a woman who flatlines, and despite his attempts to revive her, his father Christian Shephard (John Terry) forces him to stop and call the time of death. It is later revealed that it was actually Christian's operation; Jack was called in by a nurse after it becomes apparent that his father was performing the surgery under the influence of alcohol. Christian attempts to cover this up by making Jack sign a form detailing the surgery, albeit with his inebriation omitted from the report, stating that the hospital will revoke his medical license if alcohol is mentioned. However, sometime later Jack learns the patient's husband is suing the hospital. Jack and Christian then attend a board meeting discussing what went wrong during the operation. The board reveals that the deceased woman was pregnant, which was unknown by Jack. Horrified, he confesses to the board that Christian was operating under the influence during the surgery, which impaired his judgment that led to the chain of events causing the woman's death. On Day 16, October 7, 2004, back at the caves, the camp has learned from Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) that one survivor, Ethan Rom (William Mapother), is not listed in the passenger manifest. Furthermore, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) and Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) are missing. Jack and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) run through the jungle to find three distinct footprints, indicating that Ethan took Charlie and Claire. Locke decides to go back to gather a hunting party, but Jack continues alone. Locke returns with Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) and finds Jack. After they find a knuckle bandage left by Charlie as a clue, the party find two separate trails. Locke takes Boone in one direction, while Jack and Kate take the other. It soon turns out that Jack and Kate are following the correct trail when they find more of Charlie's knuckle bandages. When it starts raining, Jack believes he hears Claire screaming. Jack tumbles down an embankment to find Ethan, who warns Jack he will kill one of his captives if he does not stop following Ethan. A fistfight ensues, but Ethan gains the upper hand and subdues Jack. When he regains consciousness, Jack continues on, eventually finding Charlie, who has been hanged by Ethan. Kate cuts him down, and Jack furiously performs CPR—despite Kate's pleas that he is dead. Jack does not give up and brings Charlie back to life. Back at the caves at nightfall, Jack learns from Charlie that ""they"" only wanted Claire all along. In the meantime, Boone and Locke are still looking through the jungle. Boone decides to go back to the caves. As Locke throws him a flashlight, Boone drops it, and it lands on a metal surface embedded in the ground. Curious, the two proceed to remove the mud over it to find out what it is. ""All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues"" was written by Javier Grillo-Marxuach. Throughout the writing process, the episode went through several changes. The working title for the episode was ""What It Takes""; however, the writers deemed the title ""lame."" In writing Jack's flashback scenes, Grillo-Marxuach drew his inspiration on his own background as the son of a doctor. Two new minor characters, named Arthur and Sullivan, were originally created to accompany Locke. The idea was later scrapped in favor of including series regular Boone Carlyle; this development would serve as a genesis for the character's upcoming death in a later episode, ""Do No Harm"".[2] The idea behind the metal surface, which would be known as the hatch for the rest of the season, came when the producers were storyboarding the season.[3] The hatch's discovery was to be introduced earlier into the episode, but was moved to the end to give the episode a cliffhanger.[2] With Jack and Kate's journey, in the original outline they were to come under a dart attack by the Others, the island's native inhabitants, however it was cut because executive producer Damon Lindelof deemed the attack too ""cheesy."" Grillo-Marxuach described the ""hysterical CPR"" as ""the biggest cliché in the book,"" but added ""the nine people who were writing for the show decided, maybe we earned that. It gave us the emotional payoff for the episode.""[2] The fight scene between Jack and Ethan was performed by the actors themselves. The two were given the freedom to set up how their characters would fight each other. However, stunt coordinator Michael Vendrell wanted Ethan to be ""as feral as possible; no school of combat, karate, kung-fu."" Before filming the scene where Jack finds Charlie, episode director Stephen Williams scouted for a suitable location and found ""what looked like a cathedral,"" because of the layout of trees behind where Charlie was hung. Monaghan had to be harnessed to a cable for roughly four to five hours. The actor described the scene; ""they put me in the tree and I just hung there. I just hung limp. I tried to fall asleep, I tried to relax. When everything was going on, when they cut me down from the tree, when [Matthew Fox] was trying to revive me, when [Evangeline Lilly] was crying, I really didn't hear any of it. I just was in a semi-meditative state; however close that I could get with someone smacking me in the chest.[4] ""All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues"" received a 6.8 in the ages 18–49 demographic in the Nielsen ratings. The episode was watched by 18.88 million viewers, the sixth largest audience in American television the week it aired.[5] It was also an improvement of over 1.7 million over the previous episode, ""Raised by Another"".[6] In the United Kingdom, the episode was seen by 3.76 million viewers. It was the second highest-rated series to air on Channel 4 for the week.[7] Critical reactions of the episode were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10, calling it ""a swift return to form"" with ""plenty of striking and emotional moments"" that made it one of the better episodes of the first season. Carabott commented on the flashbacks; ""We don't necessarily learn anything new about Jack from a personality standpoint,"" but Fox did ""an exceptional job of conveying Jack's heartbreak as he reveals that his father operated on a woman while under the influence of alcohol."" He enjoyed Jack and Ethan's encounter, calling it ""chilling."" Carabott also praised the scene where Jack tries to save Charlie; ""I remember believing that they had killed off Charlie on my initial viewing and even though I knew the outcome this time, it was still a hard scene to watch,"" adding ""after Jack finally manages to resuscitate him, you have to feel for Charlie because you know that he's disappointed in himself for letting Claire down.""[8] Another IGN article ranked ""All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues"" the 33rd best Lost episode.[9] Emily VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times rated the episode the 79th of all Lost episodes (apart from the series finale), described the episode as ""thrilling,"" but opined that the show since ""has done similar things much better.""[10] Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly did not care for Jack's flashbacks, but commended the scene in which Jack saved Charlie, stating ""even though I knew he was going to go back to the CPR and save Charlie's life, I started crying. This is how you identify good TV: When you know what's going to happen and you still get swept up in it all.""[11]",5383,8.8
Whatever the Case May Be,1,12,Jack Bender,Damon Lindelof & Jennifer Johnson,Kate,2005-01-05,21.59,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatever_the_Case_May_Be,"""Whatever the Case May Be"" is the twelfth episode of the first season of Lost. It was directed by Jack Bender and written by Damon Lindelof and Jennifer Johnson. It first aired on January 5, 2005, on ABC. The character of Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. Kate is in New Mexico, applying for a loan at a bank using an alias (""Maggie"", ""Meg"", ""Miss Ryan""). Three masked men with guns enter and attempt to rob the bank. Kate is thrust to the floor in the chaos. A man tells Kate that they can stop them before he grabs and disarms one. Kate grabs the gun but when the man tells her to shoot the thief she claims that she can't use a gun. One of the thieves pulls Kate into a back room after the situation is handled and they share a kiss, revealing that Kate is a part of the robbery. The man hits Kate to make it look as if she's an innocent civilian, and threatens to kill her unless the manager takes them to the cash vaults. In the back, one of the robbers tells the manager that the whole robbery was Kate's idea. However, she shoots the felons and tells the manager to open the safety deposit box #815 — the true reason for the robbery. The manager opens the safety deposit box and Kate takes the contents inside: a single envelope. On Day 21, October 12, 2004, while swimming near a waterfall, Kate Austen and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) find a locked halliburton suitcase among some sunken wreckage. Kate wants it, but refuses to tell Sawyer what's inside, so he takes it. At the beach, the tide is rising and will soon submerge the fuselage. Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) asks her stepbrother, Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder), what he and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) do every day when they go out into the jungle, and Boone replies that they're looking for Claire Littleton, who has been kidnapped by the mysterious Ethan Rom.[2] While Shannon complains that Boone should locate food, Boone gets upset; in retaliation he calls her ""useless."" Kate enters Sawyer's tent while he's sleeping in an attempt to retrieve the case they found earlier. He wakes up, however, and they struggle, Sawyer playfully flirting with her all the while, until he takes back the case and refuses to give it to her, resulting in Kate leaving. The next day, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) asks Shannon to help him translate Danielle Rousseau's French notes. She asks if Boone put him up to asking her for help because of Boone's earlier comment. Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell) comforts Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) by telling him that what happened to Claire isn't his fault and that he did everything he could. Sawyer tries to pick the lock on the case, much to Michael Dawson's (Harold Perrineau) and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes' (Jorge Garcia) amusement. Michael tells him the only way to open it is with pure force. Sawyer drops the case off a cliff, but it still doesn't open. Kate steals it from him, but Sawyer pins her hands down and gets it back. He tells her that he will give the case to her if she tells him what's inside. She refuses. Kate goes to Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and says the case contains weapons. It belonged to the U.S. Marshal that was escorting her to the United States[3] and the key is buried with him. They dig up the body and Kate pulls out his wallet. Before giving it to Jack, she palms the key, but he catches her. Sayid becomes impatient with Shannon when her translations do not make any sense. Upset, Shannon runs away, saying that she's useless. Jack gives Sawyer an ultimatum: if he does not hand over the case, Jack will stop giving him antibiotics for his knife wound. Afraid of getting an infection in his wound, Sawyer hands over the case. At the caves, Jack and Kate open the case. There are guns inside, and a manila envelope, the same which was in the safety box: Jack gives it back to Kate. She opens it and pulls out a toy airplane. When pressured, Kate says it belonged to the man she loved - and killed.[4] She then cries, but receives no sympathy from Jack. Rose tells Charlie that she believes her husband, Bernard Nadler, who was in the tail section of the plane when it crashed, is still alive. Charlie, distraught, begs Rose for help, and she prays with him. Shannon recognizes Rousseau's notes as lyrics from ""La Mer"". By her campfire, Kate stares at the toy plane. The underwater scenes were filmed in a Los Angeles pool, due to the producers having trouble filming it in the ocean, as it had too much silt and waves, and Evangeline Lilly kept being thrown against corals.[5] This episode attracted 21.59 million American viewers.[6]The New York Times cited this episode as ""a breath of fresh air"" when comparing it to the previous few. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+. He explained, ""It’s the first time the show has used the flashback structure to actively troll the audience, and it brings the season’s worst episode thus far by nature of the fact that the rest of the episode is almost exclusively focused around the mysteries introduced in the flashback."" He summarizes his thoughts on the episode by writing, ""It’s not a terrible episode of television, but it fails to strike the balance necessary to make its flashbacks alleviate—rather than exaggerate—the challenge of slowing down the narrative to help stretch each season out into 22 or more episodes.""[7] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 7.2/10, writing that he was troubled that the episode ""takes a step back after the conclusion of the last episode"", adding that, ""It's disappointing to see the lack of momentum carried over."" Carabott added that this may have been because it aired ""after the Christmas break and it seems that the writers took this as an opportunity to regroup and prepare for the second half of the season.""[8] Ryan McGee of Zap2it was fairly critical of the episode, writing that the episode ""has interesting ideas but only semi-successful execution"", and that the episode was ""a serious let-down after the one-two punch of 'Solitary'/'Raised by Another' and the better-upon-second-viewing 'All Good Cowboys Have Daddy Issues'.""[9]",5102,8
Hearts and Minds,1,13,Rod Holcomb,Carlton Cuse & Javier Grillo-Marxuach,Boone,2005-01-12,20.810000000000002,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_and_Minds_(Lost),"""Hearts and Minds"" is the thirteenth episode of the first season of the American television series Lost. The episode sees Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) experience a vision quest, believing his stepsister Shannon (Maggie Grace) to be dead. Through a series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Boone is in love with Shannon, and that they slept together prior to crashing on the island. The episode was directed by Rod Holcomb and written by Carlton Cuse and Javier Grillo-Marxuach. The writers sought to reveal the backstory of Boone and Shannon by surprising viewers with the nature of their relationship. At the same time, they wanted to use the relationship to bring Boone and Locke closer together, and decided on a vision quest to make this happen. ""Hearts and Minds"" first aired on January 12, 2005, on ABC. The episode was watched by an estimated 20.81 million viewers and received mixed to negative critical reception. Critics tended to view Shannon and Boone's story as uninteresting, but expressed appreciation for John Locke's (Terry O'Quinn) ""darkly mysterious"" actions. Shannon calls Boone and, after he overhears sounds of violence, asks him to come to Sydney. When he gets there, he sees that her boyfriend, Bryan (Charles Mesure), has been beating her. Boone reports this to the police, and reveals that Shannon is his stepsister. While Boone is speaking to the officer, James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) is brought to the station handcuffed and shouting in anger. The detective effectively ignores Boone. Boone offers Bryan $25,000 to break up with Shannon but Bryan asks for $50,000 and Boone agrees. Boone also reveals that Bryan is not the first man he has paid off to leave Shannon alone. Shannon refuses to leave with Boone. He realizes that Shannon lied to him to get the money, and she has done this all the other times he had to pay off her boyfriends. Bryan says that Boone's mother stole money away from her, and she is getting what is rightfully hers. After a brief fight with Bryan in which he is beaten, Boone leaves. That night, a drunk Shannon comes to Boone's hotel room and tells him that Bryan stole the money. She tells Boone that she knows he loves her and, although he first tries to refuse her advances, they sleep together. Later, Shannon persuades Boone not to tell their parents. On Day 24, October 15, 2004, Boone sees that Shannon Rutherford's (Maggie Grace) relationship with Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) is getting more personal. Boone tries to tell Sayid that he would be better off staying away from Shannon, but he is ignored. Boone and Locke have been trying to open the mysterious hatch, but tell the other survivors they are hunting for boar. Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) scolds Boone for not bringing back any boar, but John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) tells Boone that what he and Boone are doing with the hatch is far more important than hunting. At the hatch, Locke makes a paste and tells Boone it is for later. Locke suggests that staring at the hatch will tell them how to open it. Boone informs Locke he is tired of lying, and wants to tell Shannon about the hatch. Locke knocks him unconscious with the handle of his knife, and Boone awakes to find himself tied up. Locke applies a strange paste on Boone's head wound and leaves a knife embedded in the ground in front of Boone so he'll be able to free himself. Locke explains that he will be able to reach it once he is properly motivated. After several unsuccessful attempts to do so, Boone hears Shannon's screams and the sounds of the 'monster' approaching. This is the impetus he needs, and after a short struggle, and in excruciating pain, he is finally able to reach the weapon. He then frees himself and searches for his sister. Boone runs through the jungle, and locates Shannon tied to a tree. Boone frees her and they run away from the pursuing monster. The monster takes Shannon, and a distraught Boone later finds her mutilated body by a creek and watches her die. That night Boone returns to the camp and tries to kill Locke, screaming that he had killed his sister, but Locke reveals that Shannon is alive. The paste caused Boone to have a vision that, according to Locke, is crucial to his experience on the island. Boone admits seeing Shannon dead made him feel relieved. Locke says to come with him, and the two disappear into the jungle. Meanwhile, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) shows Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to a garden that Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) has started. Kate discovers that Sun speaks English when the two are working in the garden, and Sun asks her not to tell anyone. Locke finds Sayid trying to make sense of Danielle Rousseau's maps, and gives him a compass. Sayid tells Jack that according to Locke's compass, north is not where it should be, causing him to believe that the instrument is defective. Hurley and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) spend the day fishing. When Hurley fails to catch anything and accidentally steps on a sea urchin after giving up, Jin treats the wound and later gives Hurley a cleaned fish that's ready to cook. Boone was the focus of ""Hearts and Minds"", a character who had not yet had his backstory told.[2][3] Ian Somerhalder was the first actor cast in the series; while the role required him to find life living in the wild foreign and difficult, the actor was raised on a Louisianan ranch and was thus used to ""learn[ing] how to survive.""[4] He said, ""[Boone] was very fragile in [the Island's] environment, where I wouldn't have been.""[4] The episode's guest stars included Charles Mesure as Bryan, Adam Leadbeater as Malcolm, and Kelly Rice as Nicole.[5] Executive producer Carlton Cuse and supervising producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who wrote the episode, decided that its plot would be centered on cementing Boone and Locke's relationship, by making the former go through a test of character.[3] The episode's plot evolved gradually, with the vision quest being one of the first ideas to include. This led to the depiction of the Shannon-Boone relationship – which had not yet been explored – and making it the ""axis"" on which to tie Locke and Boone together.[3] Cuse said that the series had hit a point narratively where Boone had become Locke's ""acolyte,"" and he needed to ""sort of shed his obsession with Shannon in order to move forward in terms of his relationship with Locke.""[6] The producers also thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest.[6] According to Cuse, the plot twist had become a Lost characteristic so they wanted to surprise the audience by having the Shannon-Boone relationship be sexual in nature. The idea for the two came from an observation that their bickering resembled an older married couple; to support this, they made the characters step-siblings as it had not yet been established what their sibling bond exactly was.[3] This was Cuse's first writing credit for Lost, having joined the series during the seventh episode. He desired to cement Boone's relationship with Locke, but was unsure how to connect the two characters in a meaningful way. The writers chose a vision quest but decided to make this ""closed to the audience"" and not let them know it was even occurring.[3] Initially, it was conceived that Boone would be convinced into eating Locke's drug, but director Rod Holcomb and the writers thought it would have made the hallucination easier to guess, and changed it into spreading the concoction into a head injury.[3] Locke knocking Boone out ""marked a huge turning point"" in the development of his character.[3] According to the writers, there was huge debate over whether Locke was good or bad; his decision was meant to be a shocking moment for viewers, since they thought people would view it as a sign that Locke was turning bad. This was characteristic of the series – the writers liked to depict a character in a certain way so that one's opinion would be made up, then they would reveal something else that would change one's mind. Locke's scene with Sayid was introduced late into production, because the episode was running short and Locke did not have scenes without Boone; Sayid's scene with Jack was also added later.[3] Many future plot points are introduced into the episode, such as Sayid observing a magnetical anomaly, main characters crossing paths (Sawyer is being arrested in the police station where Boone is filing a complaint) and Michael's box of drawings, which sets up the following episode, ""Special"".[3][7] ""Hearts and Minds"" first aired on January 12, 2005 in the United States.[5] The episode's broadcast gained an estimated 20.81 million viewers, making it ABC's sixth most watched episode for the week.[8] It earned a ratings share of 7.9/21 among adults aged 18 to 49[9] and a 4.1/13 share among teenagers, both measures attaining series highs. With this, Lost and Alias helped ABC win the night.[10] It was down 780,000 viewers on the previous episode, ""Whatever the Case May Be"",[11] but was up 5.12 million on the season average of 15.69 million viewers.[12] Critical reception of the episode was mixed to negative. Chris Carabott of IGN criticized the decision to focus the episode around Shannon and Boone, characters he felt ""[brought] very little to the table"", at the expense of other ""more intriguing"" storylines and characters. He called the episode ""awkward and uninspired"", though commented that it was saved by the character development of Locke. Carabott rated the episode 6.6 out of 10, signifying a ""passable"" episode.[13]Entertainment Weekly writer Adam B. Vary graded the episode with a B+ and praised Somerhalder for bringing ""some real pathos to his conflicted feelings for Shannon; he also found Locke to be ""at his best when his motivations are darkly mysterious.""[14] Writing for Zap2it, Ryan McGee characterized the episode as having a ""weak backstory with a creeptastic ending,"" although he enjoyed Locke for being ""incredibly sage and incredibly terrifying all at once.""[7] In her 2006 work Finding Lost: The Unofficial Guide, Nikki Stafford critiqued the writers for having some of the characters act inconsistently with the events of previous episodes, citing Jack and Kate's ""jokey and sweet"" interactions as an example.[15] Robert Dougherty, author of the 2008 book Lost Episode Guide for Others: An Unofficial Anthology, compared Shannon and Boone's relationship to that of a soap opera. Other than the revelations surrounding their relationship and Locke's actions however, Dougherty did not think the episode would have much of an impact on the series' overall story.[16] Therese Odell of the Houston Chronicle reviewed the episode twice, once in September 2007, then again following a repeat viewing in July 2009. She called it ""profoundly weird"",[17] and described it as a ""transition episode"", noting that on her original viewing she found it irritating, eager for the story to advance, but upon re-watching it enjoyed it more, praising the ""lovely exploration of Boone's character"".[18] Following the series' conclusion, IGN ranked ""Hearts and Minds"" 109th out of all episodes, commenting that as few viewers were interested in Shannon and Boone, it was difficult to be interested in an episode centered on them, particularly as it had little long-term impact.[19] A similar ranking of episodes by Emily VanDerWerff for the Los Angeles Times placed ""Hearts and Minds"" 104th.[20]",5071,8.2
Special,1,14,Greg Yaitanes,David Fury,Michael & Walt,2005-01-19,19.69,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_(Lost),"""Special"" is the 14th episode of the first season of the American drama television series Lost. The episode was directed by Greg Yaitanes and written by David Fury. It first aired on ABC in the United States on January 19, 2005. The characters of Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) and his son Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley) are featured in the episode's flashbacks. ""Special"" received positive reviews from critics, with praise given to Michael's relationship with Walt and Perrineau's performance. The episode was seen by an estimated 19.69 million household viewers. In 1997 , Michael and his partner, lawyer Susan Lloyd (Tamara Taylor), have a son, Walt. When Walt was only a few months old, Susan accepted a job in Amsterdam and took her child with her. Months later, Michael calls Susan, and she reveals to have started a relationship with her former boss, Brian Porter (David Starzyk). Michael says he is coming to Amsterdam, not for Susan, but to take his son back. Hanging up, Michael storms away but, forgetting to look, walks out into the middle of the road and is hit by an oncoming vehicle. While Michael is in the hospital recovering, Susan appears and says she will be marrying Brian and he wants to adopt Walt as his legal son. Michael refuses; Susan questions his motives, suggesting that Michael is holding on for his own stubborn principles rather than love for his son. In September 2004, Brian, Susan and Walt live in Sydney, Australia. Walt is hinted to have some sort of supernatural power over his surroundings; when he opens one of his books to a picture of a native bird, and shortly afterward an identical real-life bird fatally slams into a nearby window. Shortly later, Susan dies from an unspecified form of blood disorder. Brian comes to New York to tell this to Michael, and says it was Susan's wish that Michael be given custody. Michael soon sees past this, and realizes Brian does not care for Walt, only pursuing paternal rights in the past to please Susan. He offers Michael plane tickets to and from Sydney, inviting him to come and take Walt. Michael is livid that Brian would willingly abandon Walt, but is confused when Brian says the boy is different, and ""things happen when he is around"". Michael then goes to Brian's house in Sydney, where he picks up Walt and his dog, Vincent. On Day 26, October 17, 2004, an annoyed Michael Dawson confronts Walt Lloyd, whom John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) has been teaching how to throw a knife, and enlists his help in scavenging parts from the wreck to build a raft. The next day, Walt tells his dad that he is going to get some water and runs off with his dog, Vincent (Madison). Michael initially accuses Locke of contributing to his son's delinquency despite his repeated warnings, but when he sees that the boy is not with Locke, the two men track Walt into the jungle. Michael risks his own life to save Walt from one of the island's unlikely predators, a polar bear, thus aiding the reconciliation between the two. Michael then gives Walt a wooden box that holds all the letters he wrote to Walt, but his mother never delivered. Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) recovers Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) diary from James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) with help from Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly). As he skims through it, hoping to find some mention of him in her musings, he reads her description of a dream about a ""black rock"" which corresponds to a location on the map that Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) stole from Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan).[2] He shows this to the others, thinking it might be a clue to her whereabouts. However, while looking for Vincent, who disappeared shortly after Walt was attacked by the bear, Locke and Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) are shocked by the sudden appearance of Claire, stumbling out of the jungle. ""We sort of have ideas. 'Gee, Walt's reading a comic book about polar bears, and a polar bear shows up.' Or, 'Walt is reading a book about birds, and a bird flies into the window.' I know what I mean by it, but I think when the audience starts getting disconnected is when you tell them what to think, which is: Walt is psychic."" Executive producer Damon Lindelof on developing Walt[3] ""Special"" was written by David Fury and directed by Greg Yaitanes.[4] The episode features the father-son characters of Michael and Walt in its flashback scenes.[5] Malcolm David Kelley, the child actor who portrayed Walt, had appeared in various film and television projects since a young age before earning a casting call on Lost. A week after his audition, Kelley was told he had won the part.[6] As he was near the age of 12 when cast, series co-creator Damon Lindelof knew the actor's puberty was eventually going to be a problem and discussed it with J. J. Abrams during filming of the pilot episode. Lindelof recalled in 2014, ""There was an inevitability to Malcolm. In fact, casting an actor who... was sort of right on the cusp of blooming, we were in dangerous territory"".[7] Once they reached the middle of the season, Lindelof and Carlton Cuse decided to resolve the problem by having Walt be abducted in the season finale.[7] Lindelof described Walt's abilities as ""mythological magic,"" writing that he ""had these kind of psychic abilities in a Stephen King kind of way. Birds are smashing into windows, and we are calling an episode 'Special'.""[7] According to writer Nikki Stafford, two situations imply Walt summons animals – he causes a bird to fly into a window while reading a book on birds, and he makes a polar bear attack him after reading a comic book about such a bear.[8] The polar bear was mostly depicted through computer generated imagery, with an animatronic head and puppeteers wearing bear arms being used for close-ups.[3] ""Special"" first aired on January 19, 2005 in the United States.[4] It experienced only a slight decline from the season's earlier high-rated episodes.[9] The episode's premiere earned an estimated 19.69 million American viewers,[10] and finished first in its timeslot. It garnered an overall ratings share of 12.6/19, and in the adult demographic it earned a share of 7.9/21, placing sixth among adults aged 18 to 49.[11][12] ""Special"" was well received by critics. Chris Carabott of IGN called Michael's flashback ""heart wrenching"" and praised Perrineau's ""brilliant performance"" at ""expressing the heartbreak that Michael is feeling.""[13] He rated ""Special"" with a score of 7.8 out of 10, an indication of a ""good"" episode.[13] Kirthana Ramisetti from Entertainment Weekly called it the best episode since ""Walkabout"" because of Michael's character development.[14] She said that one of her favorite scenes of the entire season ""was Michael and Walt bonding over the letters and the drawing of the sunburned penguin. It was moving to see these two finally relating to each other as father and son after everything they've been through.""[14] In her 2006 work Finding Lost: The Unofficial Guide, Nikki Stafford considered the episode's flashbacks to be ""some of the most emotionally painful ones yet"" due to the lack of control over his circumstances. She also praised Monaghan's comic timing.[15] Robert Dougherty, author of the 2008 book Lost Episode Guide for Others: An Unofficial Anthology, classified it as a ""must see episode"", explaining that it redefined Michael and Walt's relationship to viewers, introduced ""new mysteries,"" and had a good cliffhanger.[16] After the series' conclusion in 2010, IGN ranked ""Special"" as the 86th best episode of the series, noting that while ""Michael was not the most popular character,"" Perrineau gave a ""great performance.""[17] On a similar list, the Los Angeles Times ranked ""Special"" as the 87th best, observing that the episode's few ""fantastic moments"" were marred by its ""terrible, terrible special effects.""[18]",4945,8.2
Homecoming,1,15,Kevin Hooks,Damon Lindelof,Charlie,2005-02-09,19.479999999999997,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homecoming_(Lost),"""Homecoming"" is the 15th episode of the first season of the American drama television series Lost. It aired on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada on February 9, 2005. The episode was written by executive producer Damon Lindelof and directed by Kevin Hooks. The episode sees the return of Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), who escaped after she was kidnapped by Ethan Rom (William Mapother).[2] However, her return meant that all the survivors' lives are in danger, and the team have to figure out a way to stop Ethan. Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. ""Homecoming"" was seen by nineteen-and-a-half million American viewers, and received mixed to positive reviews, where Charlie's backstory received general praise. Lindelof, however, would later consider it one of his least favorite Lost episodes, as he felt exploring Charlie's drug addiction once again was a wrong move. The flashbacks show Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) in the height of his drug addiction. To make money for more heroin, Tommy (Darren Richardson) tells him about Lucy Heatherton (Sally Strecker), whose father is rich. He plans for Charlie to steal something of value from her, and then sell it. Once invited to her house, Charlie has an interest in stealing a cigarette case that had belonged to Winston Churchill. However, he develops feelings for Lucy, and takes a job selling photocopiers so he can become respectable, which Tommy opposes. Eventually, Charlie's withdrawal gets to him and he takes the cigarette case before taking the job. His plan to become respectable backfires as he passes out after throwing up under the lid of the photocopier he is demonstrating, and the prospective clients, who work for one of Lucy's father's companies, find the valuable antique in his jacket. When he goes to see Lucy to explain, she refuses to hear his explanation and tells Charlie that he will never take care of anyone. On Day 27, October 18, 2004, Locke (Terry O'Quinn) finds Claire (Emilie de Ravin),[3] but after she wakes up, she has no recollection of the crash, nor the other castaways, including Charlie himself. The next day, Ethan (William Mapother) confronts Charlie, and threatens to kill one survivor each day until Claire is brought back to him. Taking the threat seriously, several of the castaways set up security measures and traps around the settlement to avoid Ethan carrying out his threat. The next morning, on Day 29, unfortunately, Ethan manages to slip through from the ocean and kills Scott (Dustin Watchman) during the night. Although hesitant at first, Jack (Matthew Fox) plans on using the guns from the marshal's briefcase[4] to set up a trap to capture Ethan, using Claire as bait. Charlie wishes to join him, but is turned down. Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Kate (Evangeline Lilly), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), Jack and Locke await in ambush for Ethan to show himself and grab Claire. When he arrives, Jack manages to stop and eventually subdue Ethan. However, before they can interrogate him, Charlie takes Jack's gun and shoots Ethan dead. When questioned about why he killed Ethan, Charlie tells Jack that he ""deserved to die"". In the end, Claire remembers Charlie's imaginary peanut butter,[5] visits him and tells him that she wants to trust him. In one of the flashback scenes, Lucy tells Charlie that her father is out of town buying a paper company in Slough. This a reference to the British mockumentary television series The Office, of which Lost co-creator J. J. Abrams is a fan, and later director for the American version.[6]William Mapother said that he was frustrated upon learning of his death scene as he looked forward to being in more episodes. The actor later declared he ""felt sorry"" and had sympathy for Ethan, as ""he was unarmed, and Charlie pulled out a gun.""[7] ""Homecoming"" received a total figure of 19.48 million viewers, and a rating of 7.0 in the United States. This placed Lost number six on the most viewed series for the week.[8] In Canada, the episode was viewed by 1.849 million people, placing Lost the ninth most viewed series in the country.[9] In the United Kingdom, the episode was viewed by 3.33 million people, placing Lost the third most viewed series on Channel 4 for the week.[10] Reviews of the episode were generally mixed to positive. Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode an ""impressive"" 8.2 out of 10. He praised the episode for Charlie's role in it, stating that the backstory was a ""straightforward flashback with no hidden message or deeper meaning, it simply does a great job of contrasting the Charlie we now know on the island"". Charlie's jealousy, anger and fear of feeling like he is underused in regards to helping Claire develops well into the scene where he kills Ethan. Carabott also stated Ethan's death was to be expected, but didn't want it to happen.[11] IGN ranked Ethan's death as number three in the Top 10 'Lost' deaths, stating that his death was the most frustrating on Lost because Ethan could have provided many answers to the island's mysteries.[12] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly was overly critical of the episode, including how the writers wrote Claire to have amnesia during the episode, stating the series could do better with writing the episode, as well as being critical of Jack's success in subduing Ethan, since he lost to fighting Ethan previously on ""All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues"". Jenson did however, like Charlie's ""little anecdote"" from his past, and the scene where his plan to be respectable backfired gave Monaghan a chance to demonstrate his gift for light comedy.[13] Mac Slucom of Film Fodder dubbed the episode a ""real treat"", and though the Lost crew deserves praise for Ethan's capture and death, but described Charlie's flashbacks as a ""big time distraction"" from the developments on the island.[14] In 2009, episode writer and show creator Damon Lindelof quoted this episode as one of his least favorite, saying that it ""was flawed on almost every single level that an episode of Lost could be"".[15] Lindelof would later detail that his frustration owed to the wrong decisions on expanding the Charlie character, given they were again exploring the drug addiction angle.[16]",4980,8.4
Outlaws,1,16,Jack Bender,Drew Goddard,Sawyer,2005-02-16,17.87,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaws_(Lost),"""Outlaws"" is the 16th episode of the first season of the American drama television series Lost. The episode was directed by Jack Bender and written by Drew Goddard. It first aired on ABC in the United States on February 16, 2005. The character of James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. The episode was seen by an estimated 17.87 million household viewers. Sawyer has a nightmare about the night, as a child, he was told by his mother to hide under his bed while she went to the door to tell his father to leave. In the dream, his father forces his way into the house, kills his mother, sits on the bed Sawyer is hiding under, and kills himself. A former associate, Hibbs (Robert Patrick), tells Sawyer the real Sawyer who ruined his life as a child is now living under the alias Frank Duckett in Australia. Sawyer travels there, buys a gun, and goes to the shrimp shop where Duckett works. He chats with him briefly, but doesn't kill him. Sawyer goes to an Australian bar and happens to meet Christian Shephard(John Terry) who tells Sawyer some people are meant to suffer, and ""that's why the Red Sox will never win the damn Series."" He says he wishes he had the strength to call his son, say how proud he is of him, and ""fix everything"", but he is too weak to do it. Christian tells Sawyer to fix the thing that's making him feel bad. Sawyer shoots Frank Duckett, but Frank denies being the real Sawyer, telling Sawyer he owed Hibbs money—Sawyer realizes this is the real reason Hibbs sent him after Duckett. Duckett tells Sawyer ""It'll come back around"", the phrase whispered when Sawyer encounters the boar. In the middle of the night, Sawyer wakes up to find a giant boar in front of him and it attacks his tent and runs away into the trees, taking Sawyer's tarp with it. Sawyer chases after it, and while he is in the jungle he hears whispering. A louder whisper says ""It'll come back around"". In the morning, on Day 30, October 21, 2004, Sawyer talks to Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) about the voices Sayid heard while he was in the jungle before, and when Sayid asks why he wants to know, Sawyer shrugs it off. Sawyer is obsessed with finding the boar that attacked him and goes into the jungle with Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) to find it. During a drinking game (""I Never...""), they both reveal to each other that they've killed a man. The next morning, on Day 31, the two of them wake up to find that Sawyer's belongings have been ruined while Kate's remain untouched. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) joins them and tells them his sister died very young and their foster mother blamed herself, suffering a severe depression. But a few months later, a dog came into the house, without tags or collar. The dog slept in his sister's room, but when his mother died 5 years later, the dog vanished. Locke says his mother believed the dog was his sister who came back to tell her that her death wasn't her fault. Sawyer catches up to the boar and decides not to kill it, and gives Jack Shephard(Matthew Fox)his gun. Now all the firearms are with Jack, who locks them back in the marshal's case. They start to talk, and Jack says, ""that's why the Sox will never win the Series."" Sawyer realizes Christian is Jack's father, but does not tell Jack that he met Christian. The Boston Red Sox professional baseball team won the World Series in 2004 (4 months before ""Outlaws"" aired). This episode attracted 17.87 million American viewers.[2]",5086,8.6
...In Translation,1,17,Tucker Gates,Javier Grillo-Marxuach & Leonard Dick,Jin,2005-02-23,19.49,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...In_Translation,"""...In Translation"" is the 17th episode of the first season of the American drama television series Lost. The episode was directed by Tucker Gates and written by Javier Grillo-Marxuach and producer Leonard Dick. It first aired on ABC in the United States on February 23, 2005. The character of Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) is featured in the episode's flashbacks, revealing his disturbing job experience under Mr. Paik (Byron Chung), the father of his wife Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim). In the present, Michael's (Harold Perrineau) unfinished raft catches fire overnight, leading him and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) to blame Jin for the incident. The episode title is a reference to the phrase ""lost in translation"", where a phrase or idiom loses its meaning when translated between languages. ""...In Translation"" was seen by an estimated 19.49 million American household viewers. It received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, with praise given to the episode developing the characters of Jin and Sun, while the lack of progress in the series' narrative was criticized. Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) visits Sun's (Yunjin Kim) father, Mr. Paik (Byron Chung), to ask for his daughter's hand in marriage. Mr. Paik asks Jin about his dreams and his family. Jin states that he would like to own his own restaurant and hotel, and that his father is deceased, as well as telling Mr. Paik that he would do anything for Sun. Mr. Paik offers Jin a job but is unspecific about its requirements. Later, Jin tells Sun that they will be able to go on their honeymoon after he does some management training. Jin gets promoted and Mr. Paik assigns him to go to the house of the Secretary for Environmental Safety, Byung Han, to ""deliver a message"" regarding Mr. Paik's disappointment with Han's decision to close the factory. There, he tells Mr. Han that Mr. Paik is displeased with him. As a way to make Mr. Paik happy, Mr. Han gives Jin a puppy, the same dog seen earlier in Sun's flashbacks. Sun prepares a candlelit dinner for her husband, but they are interrupted by Mr. Paik, who is upset that his factory has been closed. Mr. Paik blames Jin for not delivering the message properly - Jin didn't fully understand that he was being asked to threaten the secretary. Mr. Paik sends Jin, along with a mercenary companion wielding a silenced pistol, back to Mr. Han's house. To save the man's life, Jin brutally beats up Mr. Han right in front of his wife and young daughter. He tells him that the factory must open tomorrow, and tells the mercenary Mr. Han got the message. He returns home and washes blood from his hands (the same flashback shown from Sun's perspective in the past), but this scene is now followed with Jin crying for what he has been forced to do. Jin visits his father in a fishing village, revealing that Jin lied about his father being dead to Mr. Paik, and begs for forgiveness for being ashamed of him. His father embraces him. They talk about the marital difficulties, and Jin expresses his wish to ""start over"". After commenting that Mr. Paik's next job for Jin is to go sell watches to his associates in Sydney and Los Angeles, Jin is told by his father to go to America with Sun to start a new life. On Day 32, October 23, 2004, Sun is wearing a bikini, but Jin rushes to cover her as they argue. Jin becomes forceful during the argument and shoves her into the sand. Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) rushes to her aid and threatens Jin. Sun slaps Michael in the face. He stands there shocked as Jin and Sun walk away. As Sun dresses, Jin asks if she is involved with Michael and she says no. Sun apologizes to Michael for slapping him while he is working on the raft. She said that she did it to protect Michael, because he doesn't know what Jin can do, implying her slapping him saved him from a far worse beating. Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) flirt, while Michael works on the raft. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) comes over and Michael tells him the raft can only fit four people. Jack asks about the available spots on the raft and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) says that he bought one in exchange for some building materials. At night the raft catches fire and all the islanders, namely Michael and Sawyer, angrily blame Jin. Sun then finds Jin covered with burns and he does not speak to her. Sayid informs Shannon's stepbrother, Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder), that he may be dating Shannon, and Boone warns him that she is using him. The next day, Sayid tells Shannon that it might not be a good idea for them to date. Shannon goes to confront Boone, but runs into Locke instead. He advises her to start a new life rather than confront Boone. Sawyer ambushes Jin while he is gathering water and knocks him out with a kick to the head. He ties Jin up and escorts him to the beach. Back at the beach, Michael beats Jin up. As the beating intensifies, Sun surprises everyone, including Jin, by revealing for the first time publicly that she can speak English; she tells Michael to stop and that Jin did not burn the raft, and that the reason Jin's hands are burnt is because he was trying to put the fire out. Locke quells the growing argument by stating that it would be unlikely that one of the survivors burned the raft, suggesting that ""the Others"" (the possible comrades of Ethan) are responsible and that they aren't alone on the island. Michael decides to make a new raft. Sun goes to see Jin and says (in English) that she was going to leave him and that he changed her mind about leaving. Speaking Korean, she asks him if they can ""start all over"". However, Jin tells her that it is too late. At night, Shannon decides to stay with Sayid even though Boone does not like Sayid around her. Locke reveals that he knows Walt burnt the raft when he asks him why he did it, though he promises not to tell anyone. Walt replies by stating that he doesn’t want to move anymore (he has moved many times throughout his life), and that he likes it on the island and doesn't want change. The next morning, on the beach, Sun goes into the ocean in a bathing suit as a free, but lonely woman, and Jin helps Michael build a new raft. Meanwhile, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) listens to Damien Rice's ""Delicate"" on his CD player, but the song cuts off midway when the batteries die. The episode was directed by Tucker Gates and written by Javier Grillo-Marxuach and Leonard Dick.[2] Its flashbacks are from Jin's perspective and mirror those seen in ""House of the Rising Sun"",[3][4] an earlier episode also written by Grillo-Marxuach.[5] It was filmed in January 2005.[6] The episode's guest actors included John Shin, an actor from San Francisco, as Jin's father Mr. Kwon. Despite meeting Dae Kim on their first day of shooting, Shin sought to exude joy and warmth over seeing his character's son again.[7] ""...In Translation"" first aired in the United States on February 23, 2005.[2] An estimated 19.49 million viewers watched the episode,[8] which finished in second place for the night among all major American networks, behind American Idol. Among viewers aged 18–49, the episode finished in ninth place for the week with a ratings share of 7.5/20.[9][10] Writing in 2008 for IGN, Chris Carabott criticized the episode for not advancing the series' narrative, describing it as ""yet another good character piece"" but ""fail[ing] at really moving the story forward at all.""[3] In another IGN article in 2014, Eric Goldman ranked ""...In Translation"" as 101st out of all the episodes of Lost, with the episode's low position also due to its lack of narrative advancements.[11] In a 2009 list of his favorite Lost moments, Zap2It's Ryan McGee praised ""...In Translation"" for ""recontextualiz[ing] Sun's flashbacks in ""House of the Rising Sun"", calling this ""storytelling of the highest order.""[12] Dan Kawa of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B.[13] In a 2013 ranking of all Lost episodes, Emily VanDerWerff called Sun and Jin's relationship ""the best romance on the show"" after Desmond and Penny.[14] Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club wrote in 2014 that the episode was ""beautifully rendered"", and gave it an A.[4]",4963,8.5

He then visits an asylum where he'd resided for a time to talk to a patient there, Leonard Simms, who continually mutters the numbers Hurley used to win the lottery. When Hurley tells him about this, Lenny turns lucid, panics, and shouts that ""The numbers are bad!"" As the hospital staff drag him away, Leonard tells Hurley to find Sam Toomey in Kalgoorlie, Australia. Hurley travels to Kalgoorlie and learns that Toomey died four years before. His widow Martha explains how Toomey and Leonard served together in the U.S. Navy, stationed at a listening post in the Pacific where they monitored longwave radio transmissions. Most of what they heard was static, but at one point in 1988 (which coincides with the time Rousseau was stranded on the island), they picked up a signal of a human voice repeating the numbers over and over. After using the numbers to win a guessing jar game at a fair, Toomey experienced a steady stream of bad luck until he finally committed suicide by shotgun. Despite this, Martha asserts that there is no curse, and that ""You make your own luck."" Looking at some of the documents Sayid found in Rousseau's camp, Hurley notices repeated notations of ""4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42,"" the same numbers he used to win the lottery. Agitated by this, Hurley sets off on his own to find Rousseau, ignoring Sayid's warnings. The next day, Hurley finds the same mysterious cable Sayid had followed, which extends from the ocean up into the hills and then disappears into the underground near a ravine with a rope bridge across it. Rousseau has since set traps alongside the cable, but through apparent good luck, Hurley keeps avoiding getting hurt. Sayid, Jack, and Charlie eventually catch up with him. The group come to the bridge, which Hurley crosses first, since he's the heaviest. It then collapses under Charlie's much lighter weight, and the group is separated. Jack and Sayid arrive at Rousseau's old shelter, only to set off another trap, causing an explosion which destroys it. Sayid surmises that Rousseau expected him to return. Meanwhile, Hurley and Charlie split up after being shot at, and Hurley encounters Rousseau, who holds him at gunpoint. Hurley refuses to back down, and adamantly insists that she tell him what the numbers mean. Convinced of his sincerity, she lowers her gun, but then says that she does not know. Her party was drawn to the Island by the numbers radio transmission, but their ship was wrecked by submerged rocks. It took them weeks to find the transmission tower, which was near ""the Black Rock,"" but her team became ""sick."" After the rest of them were gone, Rousseau changed the message to her own distress call. Musing on how the numbers were evidently responsible for bringing both of them to the Island, and that just as they brought bad luck to him, they caused her to lose everything she cared about, Rousseau concludes that they are indeed cursed. Hurley is relieved to have finally found someone who agrees with him, and hugs her. Hurley makes his way back to Sayid, Jack, and Charlie, giving them a battery from Rousseau, which can be used for Michael's raft. On the beach, Charlie reveals his heroin addiction to Hurley, who in turn reveals how wealthy he actually is, although Charlie thinks this is a joke and storms off. The numbers are then shown to be engraved on the side of the hatch Boone and Locke found. Meanwhile, Locke asks Claire to help him build something with wood. Whe he finishes, turns out it was a cradle for Claire's future baby. Claire is thankful and reveals it was her birthday today. A reference is made to Curb Your Enthusiasm, as Hurley is mistaken for a drug dealer and arrested. In Curb Your Enthusiasm, Jorge Garcia plays a drug dealer, and his role as the drug dealer got him the role of Hurley in Lost.[2] The episode had 18.85 million American viewers.[3] In Chris Carabott of IGN's review of ""Numbers"", in which Rousseau makes her second appearance, Carabott described Hurley and Rousseau's encounter as ""the episode's best moment"", as ""Hurley finds comfort with someone who we would least expect.""[4]Lost co-creator J. J. Abrams commended Furlan for giving the character ""heart and soul"", and managed to make her ""identifiable and complex"".[5] After the episode aired, numerous people used the eponymous figures (4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42) as lottery entries. According to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, within three days, the numbers were tried over 500 times by local players.[6] Likewise, in the same period, over 200 people in Michigan alone used the sequence for the Mega Millions lottery[7] and by October, thousands had tried them for the multi-state Powerball lottery.[8][9] The issue came to attention after a Mega Millions drawing for a near-record US$380,000,000 jackpot on January 4, 2011 drew a series of numbers in which the three lowest numbers (4-8-15) and the mega ball (42) matched four of the five numbers. The #42 is also the ""Mega Number"" in Hurley's ""Mega Lotto"" ticket. The players who played the combination won $150 each (or $118 in California).[10]",5709,9.1
Deus Ex Machina,1,19,Robert Mandel,Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof,Locke,2005-03-30,17.75,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_Machina_(Lost),"""Deus Ex Machina"" is the 19th episode of the first season of the American drama television series Lost. The episode was directed by Robert Mandel and written by executive producers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof. It first aired on ABC in the United States on March 30, 2005. The character of John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is featured in the episode's flashbacks, revealing how he discovered who his parents were, only to realize in the end that they conned him for selfish reasons. In the present, John is having a personal crisis due to his and Boone's (Ian Somerhalder) inability to open the hatch they unearthed. Meanwhile, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) reveals to Sawyer (Josh Holloway) that the latter has hyperopia, or far-sightedness. ""Deus Ex Machina"" was seen by an estimated 17.75 million American household viewers. A non-paraplegic John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) meets a mysterious woman (Swoosie Kurtz) in the discount superstore in which he works. After an initial meeting, Locke later notices the same woman watching him in the store's parking lot. He chases after her to confront her and she explains that she is his birth mother, Emily Locke. Locke asks about his father and Emily claims that Locke doesn't have a father because he was immaculately conceived. Undeterred, Locke hires a private investigator who finds Locke's father, Anthony Cooper (Kevin Tighe). When Locke visits his father's affluent home he is welcomed with open arms. Locke forms a strong relationship with his father, who now frequently takes him hunting. One day Locke arrives at the home early and discovers his father receiving dialysis treatment. Eventually Locke offers one of his kidneys to save his father. After the surgery, Locke wakes up in the hospital to find that his father has discharged himself home for private care and abandoned him. Emily arrives to explain that when Anthony realized he needed a kidney, he tracked down their son and paid her to make contact with him, presumably for the sole purpose of getting the transplant. Devastated, Locke pulls himself out of the hospital bed and drives to his father's home, but is regretfully turned away by the gate guard, with whom he has become friendly. As he drives away, Locke breaks down over the betrayal. It is Day 39, October 30, 2004, on the island, Locke and Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) build a trebuchet in an effort to break open the hatch window. When this fails, an exasperated Locke pounds the hatch. Boone notices a shard in Locke's leg but Locke says he feels no pain and that night he discovers he is losing the feeling in his legs. Meanwhile, James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) is suffering from headaches and a sensitivity – Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) diagnoses this as farsightedness caused by the strain placed on Sawyer's eyes due to his large amount of reading since arriving on the island. Using spare glasses found from the wreckage and Sayid Jarrah's (Naveen Andrews) engineering skills, Jack offers Sawyer a new pair of glasses to read with. Locke and Boone are at the hatch again, and while Locke is undeterred Boone is becoming fatalistic and believes their continued efforts to open it a waste of time. Locke asserts that the island will send them a sign about the hatch. Then Locke sees a Beechcraft 18 that crashed in the jungle, then sees his mother, himself on a wheelchair, and blood-covered Boone uttering the phrase ""Theresa falls up the stairs, Theresa falls down the stairs."", which is revealed to be a dream. Locke awakens and wakes up Boone to head out in search of the aircraft, but Locke has suddenly found himself losing the use of his legs as he can no longer stably walk. During the walk, they discover a decayed body in a Catholic priest's clothing, carrying Nigerian currency and an unloaded handgun. When Locke falls, Boone tries to convince him to return to camp, but Locke convinces him to continue by mentioning the phrase he heard Boone say in his dream. Boone reveals that Theresa was his nanny when he was a child who broke her neck on the stairs one day; at this point, the two spot the plane in a tree. Because Locke is unable to walk, Boone must climb the tree to search the plane alone. He discovers a trove of statues of the Virgin Mary filled with heroin, the decayed body of another man dressed as a priest, and a working radio. Boone sends out a distress call on the radio and a male voice answers, ""Is someone out there?"" to which Boone responds, ""We are the survivors of the crash of Oceanic Flight 8-1-5."" The voice answers ""We're the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815!"" At this point the teetering plane shifts from Boone's movements and suddenly falls to the ground, crashing nose first. Frantically, Locke struggles to his feet, hoists a critically injured Boone on his shoulders, and returns to the camp. Locke carries Boone to the cave and lies to Jack, telling him that Boone fell from a cliff while they were hunting. Jack begins treating Boone, and Locke disappears into the jungle to return to the hatch. Locke pounds on the door and screams in anguish at how he has done everything the island has asked him to do, and how he is both losing his ability to walk and unable to open the door. Suddenly the hatch window is illuminated. This was the first episode to be written by both creator Damon Lindelof and ""Hearts and Minds"" writer Carlton Cuse. 17.75 million American viewers tuned in to this episode.[2]",5603,9.1
Do No Harm,1,20,Stephen Williams,Janet Tamaro,Jack,2005-04-06,17.12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_No_Harm_(Lost),"""Do No Harm"" is the twentieth episode of the first season of Lost. The episode was directed by Stephen Williams and written by Janet Tamaro. It first aired on April 6, 2005, on ABC. While trying to make contact with the outside world from a plane discovered in the jungle tree canopy, Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) is critically injured when the plane suddenly shifts and crashes to the ground, so Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) desperately tries to save his life. The flashbacks in this episode revolve around Jack's marriage to a former patient, Sarah (Julie Bowen). Flashbacks show both the build-up to, and the event of Jack's wedding to Sarah, a former patient whom he ""fixed"" after she was injured in a car accident. Jack agonizes over his vows, and his father, Christian (John Terry) surprises him by showing up, giving Jack advice about writing the vows by the pool. His father says that Jack's strength is commitment, and that his problem is that he is ""just not good at letting go."" Jack thinks over his father's words, and eventually writes his vows just in time for the ceremony, finally settling on extolling how Sarah has ""fixed"" him. Boone has been critically injured by his fall inside the Beechcraft in the previous episode. He has lost a lot of blood, one of his lungs has collapsed and his right leg is crushed. Jack sends Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) off to get some alcohol from James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway). On her way back, she discovers that Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) has gone into unexpected labour. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) surprises Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) with a ""torchlit dinner"". Shannon tells Sayid that Boone is only her step-brother, and that he is ""kind of"" in love with her. Boone needs a transfusion of type A-negative. Jack sends Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) to find one of the other survivors with a matching blood type. When he unsuccessfully returns (only four people knew their blood type), Jack decides to give Boone some of his O-negative blood. Jack tries to use bamboo as a needle but can't pierce his skin. Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) solves the problem by providing a sea urchin. Using the urchin's spines, Jack begins to give Boone his blood. Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), while working on the new raft, hears Kate's call for help and rushes to her and Claire. Despite the language barrier, Kate is able to tell Jin to go and find Jack. Jin rushes to the caves but Jack is occupied with the blood transfusion. Jack tells Jin (with the aid of Sun translating) to take Charlie to Kate and Claire, and gives Charlie instructions for Kate on delivering the baby. As Jack begins to turn pale Sun stops the transfusion because the blood is pooling in Boone's dead right leg. Jack tries to save Boone's leg but it is beyond repair and Boone will die if it is not amputated. Jack asks Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) to find a way to cut off Boone's leg. Boone suddenly regains consciousness and tells Jack to just let him go. Boone reveals to Jack that he and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) discovered a mysterious hatch, and Locke told him not to tell anybody else. Boone says ""Tell Shannon I ..."" but dies without finishing the sentence. Claire gives birth to a healthy baby boy. Jack tells Shannon that Boone had died, Shannon immediately goes to the caves, and cries over Boone's dead body. Jack goes looking for Locke, thinking that Boone was murdered. In the original outline of the eleventh episode, Locke was to be accompanied by two guest characters to search for Claire and discover the Hatch.[2] In the final product, Boone accompanied Locke, a choice that would lead to Boone's death. While the executive producers have stated that Somerhalder took the news of his character's death professionally, Somerhalder has said that he found it ""pretty devastating.""[3] Boone's death is notable as the first death of a major character on the series. According to executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, Boone's death made sense from a story perspective to fuel the rivalry between Jack and Locke and lead to the events in the season finale.""[4]Variety called him ""hot-headed."" Following Somerhalder's departure from the show, ABC signed him to another one-year contract.[5] Somerhalder stated that being a part of Lost was ""the greatest experience"" of ""the greatest year of his life"".[6][7] The American viewers for this episode were 17.12 million.[8]IGN ranked Boone's death as #4 in their list of the top ten Lost deaths.[9]",5415,8.9
The Greater Good,1,21,David Grossman,Leonard Dick,Sayid,2005-05-04,17.2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greater_Good_(Lost),"""The Greater Good"" is the 21st episode of the first season of Lost. The episode was directed by David Grossman and written by Leonard Dick. It first aired on May 4, 2005, on ABC. The character of Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. Arrested at Heathrow Airport on trumped-up terrorism charges, Sayid is recruited as an informant by the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the CIA, who ask him to infiltrate a terrorist cell in Sydney of which his old friend Essam is a member. After they explain that they know where Nadia is, he agrees. It is revealed that after helping her escape several years ago, Sayid left Iraq and has been travelling the world trying to find her ever since. Sayid flies to Sydney and infiltrates the terrorist cell, telling the agents that Essam is in over his head, and that he can bring him in. The agents tell him to convince Essam to go ahead with the suicide bombing so that he will lead them to the explosives, and threaten Nadia's life when Sayid attempts to refuse. On the day of the attack, Sayid reveals he is an informant, and a distraught Essam kills himself. After Essam's death, the agents tell Sayid where Nadia is living in California, and hand him a plane ticket and money. Sayid inquires about Essam's body, and is told that because no one will claim it, the body will be burned. Sayid insists on claiming the body himself, as Essam was a Muslim man (and Muslims believe in burial, not cremation). Upon being told that his flight is in two hours so he cannot claim the body, Sayid asks them to reschedule his flight for the next day, to which they agree. At the caves, Sayid observes a mourning Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace), before asking if he can do anything for her. At the same time, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) tracks down an exhausted and obstinate Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). Jack blames John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) for Boone Carlyle's (Ian Somerhalder) death, but Kate pleads with Jack to return. At the beach, the survivors bury Boone. During the funeral, Locke arrives and attempts to explain what happened, but Jack ignores him and flies into a rage. Afterward, Jack explains to Sayid, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), and Kate that Locke is lying, but they insist that Jack must rest. Locke asks Shannon's forgiveness, to no avail; Shannon instead goes to Sayid and asks if he could do something about Locke for her (implying that she wants him to kill Locke). Meanwhile, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) tells Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) that she needs to rest, and though reluctant at first she lets him take care of her baby. Charlie has a tough time getting the baby to stop crying, even having Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) sing the song ""I Feel Good"" to no avail, but finally discovers that the sound of Sawyer's voice quiets the baby. Kate attempts to take care of Jack, who stubbornly insists he needs to deal with Locke. Realizing he'd probably try this, Kate drugs his juice and he falls asleep, leaving Sayid free to deal with Locke. Sayid arrives at the caves and begins questioning Locke, asking Locke to show him the Beechcraft. As they walk to it, Sayid interrogates Locke, who realizes just what Sayid is doing. Upon arriving at the plane, their cat-and-mouse game escalates. Sayid tells Locke he knows Locke has a gun, and Locke hands it over. He then reveals that it was he who hit Sayid over the head when he was trying to triangulate the distress signal. This enrages Sayid, who pulls the gun on Locke and questions him about the hatch. Locke lies, saying Boone was talking about the plane's hatches. Sayid returns to the beach and explains to Shannon that he believes Locke did not mean to harm Boone. This prompts an angry Shannon to take matters into her own hands. Shannon steals the guncase key from a sleeping Jack, and confronts Locke in the jungle. Kate, Jack, and Sayid arrive during the confrontation, but Shannon refuses to back down. Left with no choice, Sayid tackles Shannon just as she fires the gun, the bullet grazing Locke's head. That night, Sayid visits Locke, who thanks him for saving his life. Sayid replies that he only did it because he believes Locke to be their best chance for survival. He then tells Locke to take him to the hatch. 17.2 million American viewers tuned into this episode.[2] Chris Carabott from IGN commented ""[Boone and Shannon] were both left with very little to do this season. Especially Shannon, whose high point of usefulness was deciphering Rousseau's documents for Sayid. Well, Maggie Grace is given an opportunity to shine and she does an acceptable job as the distraught sibling who is now looking for someone to blame for Boone's death. We finally get to see some real depth to Shannon's character and her quest for vengeance is believable"".[3]",4771,8.3
Born to Run,1,22,Tucker Gates,Javier Grillo-Marxuach & Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Kate,2005-05-11,17.1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_to_Run_(Lost),"""Born to Run"" is the 22nd episode of the first season of Lost. It was directed by Tucker Gates, written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, and based on a story by Javier Grillo-Marxuach. It first aired on May 11, 2005, on ABC. The character Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. The title Born to Run is an allusion to the Bruce Springsteen song and album of the same names. Kate is changing the license plate of her car, dyeing her hair, taking a shower, as well as claiming a letter under the alias Joan Hart. She returns later to her hometown to visit her dying mother and, while there, meets up with her now-married ex-boyfriend Tom Brennan (Mackenzie Astin), who is a doctor at the hospital. The two decide to dig up a lunch box time capsule that they buried back in 1989. Among its contents are Tom's toy airplane and a tape recording that they made to mark the occasion of the burial. Later, with Tom's help, Kate is able to be alone with her mother (Beth Broderick) and apologize. Far from appeased, however, her mother begins to scream for help. Kate flees, knocking out a policeman before running into Tom, who gives her the keys to his car and climbs into it. When the police try to block their exit from the hospital, Kate implores Tom to leave, but he refuses. As the police open fire at the speeding vehicle, Kate rams theirs out of the way before crashing into another. With the car brought finally to a halt, Kate looks over at Tom and finds him dead. Distraught and left with no choice but to flee, Kate climbs out of the car and runs. Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) and Kate discuss the fame that awaits them if and when they are rescued, and this disturbs Kate. A survivor named Dr. Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), a science teacher, suddenly announces that the monsoon season is coming, where the winds go south, and that they have to go north to reach shipping lanes. He also exclaims that the raft must leave immediately so the forces of nature won't turn against them. This hits everyone hard. Thus, Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) hurries to finish the raft, and Kate seeks a spot. Michael refuses, reiterating the fact that all places have already been booked. After a conversation with Sawyer (Josh Holloway), however, he reconsiders, reasoning in spite of their deal that Sawyer has little grasp on the art of sailing and will be of little assistance once the voyage is underway. Sawyer storms off to confront Kate, whom he rightly perceives as his biggest threat, telling her that he knows why she wants to be on the raft: she wants to escape capture from authorities in the outside world. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) meet John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) at the hatch. Surprised at what he finds there, Jack asks Locke why he failed to tell anyone about it. There follows a brief confrontation between the two leaders, after which Jack states his belief that the hatch ought to be opened. This prompts a furiously nervous response from Sayid, who fears its content, and who actually brought Jack along to dissuade Locke from the idea, but the matter is left unsettled. Michael suddenly becomes ill while working with Jin (Daniel Dae Kim). Having returned from the hatch, and summoned by an urgent Kate, Jack examines him and searches for the cause of the illness. He eventually discovers some partially dissolved drugs in a water bottle from which Michael has been drinking. Upon learning of this, the afflicted immediately suspects Sawyer, but, in short order, Kate also is suspected, leading Jack to confront her about it. She denies any involvement, apparently offended that Jack should think her capable of such a thing. Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), meanwhile, assures Locke that he is not responsible either, fearing that he suspects him after his earlier sabotage of the raft. When Locke touches his arm to assure him that his fears are unfounded, Walt becomes frightened and, despite having no prior knowledge of it, begs Locke not to open ""it""; that is, the hatch. Sawyer walks up to the recovering Michael and offers him a bottle of antacid. Angry at his ostensible cheek, Michael kicks him off the raft. Furious, and finally tested beyond the bounds that his patience allows, Sawyer exposes Kate's criminalism to everyone present (significantly, Sun is not present). Snatching her bag, Sawyer empties it to reveal that Kate has stolen the passport of Joanna, the woman who drowned in ""White Rabbit"", in a bid to forge her identity. Kate reluctantly admits the truth that she was the person in the marshal's custody. As the raft is hurried toward completion, Jack walks up to Sun (Yunjin Kim) and confronts her about the poisoning. Sun admits that she is the one responsible, explaining that she wanted to keep Jin from leaving. Jack has already reasoned that, with Jin and Michael working in such close proximity, it is easy for them to mix up their water bottles. He sees no reason to reveal her indiscretion to the others, though, and promises her that he will not do so. Later, in a private conversation with Kate, Sun swears not to tell anyone that the drugging was her idea. Her reasoning is flawed, however, for she believes that Kate's idea was hatched for the sole purpose of helping her. That night, Kate and Sawyer say farewell and make something like amends, while Walt confesses to his father that he is responsible for the fire that destroyed the first raft. He explains that he wanted to stay on the island. Michael, surprised, says that they can still stay behind, but Walt insists that they leave. In the Lost: Missing Pieces mobisode ""Tropical Depression"", Dr. Arzt admits and apologizes to Michael that he made up the entire monsoon thing because he wanted the raft to leave immediately. The voice message played back by Kate and Tom was recorded on August 15, 1989, in American date format, 8/15. This relates to the Oceanic Flight 815 and two of the Numbers. 8 and 15 are both a part of the island's mysterious numbers: 4 8 15 16 23 42. Beth Broderick was on Sabrina the Teenage Witch which starred Melissa Joan Hart on ABC during the 90s and Kate's alias of Joan Hart is a reference to said show. This episode gained 17.10 million viewers when it first aired.[2]",4834,8.1
Exodus (Part 1),1,23,Jack Bender,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,various,2005-05-18,18.62,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_(Lost),"""Exodus: Part 1"" and ""Exodus: Part 2"" are collectively the first season finale of the American drama television series Lost, consisting of the 23rd episode and a double 24th and 25th episodes of the first season and the show overall. The episodes were directed by Jack Bender, and written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. In the United States, ""Part 1"" first aired on May 18, 2005, and ""Part 2"" on May 25, 2005, as a double-length season finale on ABC. In several countries, like the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia and Portugal, the double-length ""Part 2"" was split in half, resulting in the last episode being called ""Exodus: Part 3"". In these episodes, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) leads Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) to the mysterious Black Rock to get dynamite for them to blow open the hatch door, as the threat of the Others looms near. Meanwhile, Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), his son Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) set sail on the raft they built in hopes of finding rescue. Several of the survivors are shown in the final hours before the flight. Early that morning, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley) wakes up and turns on the TV. When an awakened Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) asks him to turn it off, Walt throws a tantrum and flees the room with his dog Vincent. In the airport lounge, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) converses with another passenger on his flight, Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez). James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) is told that he is being placed on Flight 815 because he is being deported by the Australian government after assaulting a government minister in a bar fight. Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is handcuffed to the Marshal (Fredric Lane). During a conversation with the customs officer, the Marshal reveals that he had baited Kate with Tom Brennan's toy airplane. When he denigrates Tom's memory, Kate attacks him, but is subdued. At the check-in, Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) waits for Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) to get them a first-class upgrade, when Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) asks her to watch his bag. She disinterestedly agrees, but when Boone returns without an upgrade, she carelessly leaves the bag. As Boone chastises her, she walks up to a police officer, telling them that ""an Arab guy"" left his bag unattended. Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) are eating in the airport cafe. Sun overhears comments from an American couple regarding her apparent submissiveness to Jin and is forced to pretend that she does not understand their conversation. Early in the morning, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) arrives at the beach to warn the survivors that The Others are coming, and tells them more of her own story. She was pregnant when she came to the island sixteen years ago but the Others—their arrival heralded by a column of black smoke—came and kidnapped her baby, whom she has not seen since. As the group resumes work on the raft, Walt notices a column of black smoke in the distance. The survivors then tell Rousseau about the hatch, and their need to open it. Rousseau offers to take them to the ""Black Rock"", where she says they can find dynamite. Jack runs into Sawyer in the jungle, and hands him a pistol with ammo ""just in case"". They share an awkward, distant goodbye. As Jack leaves, Sawyer stops him and tells him of when he met a man named Christian (John Terry) (Jack's father) in a bar in Sydney. He tells Jack what Christian said about his son, and Jack is visibly moved. Jack moves off into the jungle to find explosives. As Jack, Kate, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Dr. Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) head toward the Black Rock, Arzt is chased by The Monster, which Rousseau says is a security system protecting the island. As the raft prepares for launch, Sayid gives the team a radar emitter and flare gun, while Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) gathers messages from the remaining castaways to put in a bottle, and Walt leaves Vincent with Shannon. Sun says goodbye to Jin, handing him a notebook of phonetically written English terms to help him communicate with the others. This encourages him to speak to her and they reconcile. He says that he will still go, but because he wants to rescue her from the island. After all the goodbyes, the raft team sets off, while in the distance, the column of smoke continues to rise. Following Sun's flashback from the previous episode, Jin goes to the bathroom, he encounters a Caucasian man (John Walcutt) who reveals, in Korean, that he works for Sun's father, and knows that Jin was attempting to run away with Sun. He tells Jin to complete his delivery of a watch to Sun's father's friend in California and says he will never be free. In his hotel room, Charlie attempts to find his drugs. A girl (Terasa Livingstone), whom he has obviously slept with, asks if he has any left. He lies and says that he's run out, but she realizes that he's lying and attacks him for the drugs. Michael and Walt wait in the airport for their flight. Michael calls his mother and asks if she can take care of Walt, eventually even offering to pay her. Walt appears to overhear part of the conversation while asking Michael for batteries for his video game. Hurley awakens late for his flight due to a short-circuit in the wall outlet that leaves his alarm clock without power. In a mad dash for the airport, he experiences several problems, including a flat tire and arriving at the domestic terminal rather than international; he manages to get to the terminal just as they are closing the gate. The boarding agent is able to get them to reopen the doors for him, and he hugs her. Airline staff tell Locke that the wheelchair that is normally used to load disabled passengers on to the plane is missing, and he must be carried on by two attendants. When he drops a pamphlet from his seat, he is unable to reach it, but struggles to maintain his dignity. The final flashback is a montage that shows the group of strangers boarding the plane. Claire struggles in the aisle to get to her seat. Kate is led in handcuffs onto the plane. Sawyer searches for his seat as Charlie stores away his guitar. Jack puts his luggage into the overhead compartment, with Locke watching right behind him. Sun sits quietly with Jin, who is staring at the watch. Sayid endures the subtle racism of a fellow passenger sitting near him by looking at pictures of his lost love (Andrea Gabriel). Michael fastens the seatbelt of Walt as he plays Game Boy Advance SP, ignoring his father. Shannon frantically searches for her inhaler in her purse, but Boone gives it to her, causing her to smile. Hurley makes it on to the plane, giving Walt a thumbs-up before sitting down. Arzt helps Claire put her bag in the overhead compartment. Finally, Jack, about to sit down, catches Locke's eye, and the two politely acknowledge each other, unaware of what awaits them. The Black Rock is revealed to be the hull of a Portsmouth-registered wooden sailing ship, marooned in the jungle. After Rousseau leaves them, Locke, Kate, and Jack enter the ship through a large hole in the hull. Skeletons are found shackled together, likely the remains of slaves. Old mining equipment is also found, including at least two cases of highly-volatile dynamite sticks. Jack and Locke haul one of the cases out of the ship. While attempting to handle some of the dynamite carefully, Arzt accidentally triggers one of the sticks upon waving it around, blowing himself up. The remaining survivors decide to continue, wrap the dynamite in wet cloth, and try to carry it back to the hatch. On their way, Jack and Kate see what seems to be a small cloud of smoke move through some nearby trees, and they hear the rumbling of The Monster, which ensnares Locke's leg and drags him through the jungle. Jack grabs onto Locke to prevent him from being pulled into a hole, though Locke pleads with Jack to let him go. Jack then instructs Kate to drop a stick of dynamite into the tunnel, which causes an underground explosion, resulting in black smoke coming out of a nearby hole on the horizon, and disappearing. The hold on Locke slackens and they are able to extract him. Jack and Locke discuss the situation, and Locke says that Jack is a man of science, but that he is a man of faith. Locke believes everything that has occurred, including the death of Boone, was predestined, leading them all to the opening of the hatch. Jack disagrees, and believes that opening the hatch is a simple matter of survival. Charlie and Claire are alone on the beach when Rousseau runs up, telling Charlie that she needs to see Sayid urgently. When Charlie runs off to get Sayid, Rousseau asks Claire if she can hold her baby. Soon Charlie and Sayid (accompanied by Shannon) return, to find Claire with a head wound exclaiming that her baby has been taken, and Sayid surmises that Rousseau intends to attempt an exchange of Aaron, Claire's baby, for her own child, Alex, with the ""Others."" As evening approaches, Charlie and Sayid head toward the black smoke. During their journey, Charlie is injured by one of Rousseau's traps, and they also encounter the downed drug smugglers' plane, which Sayid, unaware of Charlie's past as an addict, reveals is full of heroin - Charlie appears conflicted as he stares at them. When Sayid and Charlie arrive on the beach with the black smoke, there are no other footprints or people, just a pyre on the sand, though they discover both the baby and Rousseau nearby. Charlie angrily accuses her of lighting the pyre herself and inventing ""the Others"" as cover for kidnapping the baby. She tearfully tells them that she overheard them saying that they were going to go after ""the boy"", and she thought that if she brought him to them, they would return her child. She returns the baby. Meanwhile, Jack, Kate, Locke and Hurley arrive at the hatch. They manage to set the dynamite up on the hinge of the hatch, and are about to set it off when Hurley notices the appearance of the numbers on the side. He yells at them not to light the fuse, but Locke does so anyway. Hurley unsuccessfully tries to stamp it out, though Jack is able to tackle him out of the way just in time to save him from the blast. At night, the raft crew's radar sweep turns up a boat in the distance. They fire their single flare, and the boat approaches them. It turns out to be a group of strangers in a small launch, who demand that they hand over Walt. Sawyer tries to pull his gun, but he is shot by one of the boat crewmen and falls into the water. Jin jumps into the water to try and save Sawyer, while the strangers overpower Michael, throwing him in the water, and kidnap Walt. As they sail off, the strangers throw an explosive on to the raft, destroying it. (This scene makes it clear that when Rousseau heard ""the Others"" say they were ""coming for the boy"", they were actually coming for Walt - and not Claire's baby, Aaron, as Rousseau misinterpreted them as meaning.) Charlie reunites the baby with Claire. It is also revealed that Charlie has kept at least one of the statues filled with heroin in his bag. Shannon finds Sayid and they embrace. The episode ends with Jack and Locke looking down into the hatch, which the explosion successfully blew off the cover of. The camera descends down the hatch; which is an extremely dark and narrow hole with a broken ladder near the top. This is the first appearance of Ana Lucia Cortez (portrayed by Michelle Rodriguez) who would go on to become a series regular in the second season.[2] This episode also marks the first appearance of Tom (M.C. Gainey), a recurring character in the following seasons. The episodes were written by executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, making it the second and third episodes they have written together. While Hurley rushes through the airport the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42 are seen on the backs of a school sports team's jerseys. 18.62 million American viewers watched ""Part 1"" live.[3] 20.71 million American viewers tuned in to ""Part 2,"" making this the most watched episode in the US since the thirteenth episode, ""Hearts and Minds.""[4] Chris Carabott from IGN ""loved"" Tom's first appearance because ""It's a great scene and our first introduction to The Others besides Ethan's infiltration of the camp.""[5] Gainey found the fan reaction to his first appearance ""really tough"", because ""everywhere [he] went people would just give [him] dirty looks and they were like 'What are you going to do with that boy?'"", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two.[6] In another IGN article, Eric Goldman ranked ""Exodus, Part 1"" as 52nd out of all the episodes of Lost, while he ranked ""Exodus, Part 2"" higher in the 19th spot, praising the tension wrought in both parts.[7] Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five ""most entertaining guest roles"" from the first three seasons, commenting ""I am counting his first episode as my favorite. For my money, there was nothing more disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and uttered the words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' I could not get that scene out of my head for days after 'Exodus' aired.""[8]",5665,9.1
Exodus (Parts 2 & 3),1,24,Jack Bender,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,various,2005-05-25,20.71,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_(Lost),"""Exodus: Part 1"" and ""Exodus: Part 2"" are collectively the first season finale of the American drama television series Lost, consisting of the 23rd episode and a double 24th and 25th episodes of the first season and the show overall. The episodes were directed by Jack Bender, and written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. In the United States, ""Part 1"" first aired on May 18, 2005, and ""Part 2"" on May 25, 2005, as a double-length season finale on ABC. In several countries, like the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia and Portugal, the double-length ""Part 2"" was split in half, resulting in the last episode being called ""Exodus: Part 3"". In these episodes, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) leads Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) to the mysterious Black Rock to get dynamite for them to blow open the hatch door, as the threat of the Others looms near. Meanwhile, Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), his son Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) set sail on the raft they built in hopes of finding rescue. Several of the survivors are shown in the final hours before the flight. Early that morning, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley) wakes up and turns on the TV. When an awakened Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) asks him to turn it off, Walt throws a tantrum and flees the room with his dog Vincent. In the airport lounge, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) converses with another passenger on his flight, Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez). James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) is told that he is being placed on Flight 815 because he is being deported by the Australian government after assaulting a government minister in a bar fight. Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is handcuffed to the Marshal (Fredric Lane). During a conversation with the customs officer, the Marshal reveals that he had baited Kate with Tom Brennan's toy airplane. When he denigrates Tom's memory, Kate attacks him, but is subdued. At the check-in, Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) waits for Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) to get them a first-class upgrade, when Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) asks her to watch his bag. She disinterestedly agrees, but when Boone returns without an upgrade, she carelessly leaves the bag. As Boone chastises her, she walks up to a police officer, telling them that ""an Arab guy"" left his bag unattended. Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) are eating in the airport cafe. Sun overhears comments from an American couple regarding her apparent submissiveness to Jin and is forced to pretend that she does not understand their conversation. Early in the morning, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) arrives at the beach to warn the survivors that The Others are coming, and tells them more of her own story. She was pregnant when she came to the island sixteen years ago but the Others—their arrival heralded by a column of black smoke—came and kidnapped her baby, whom she has not seen since. As the group resumes work on the raft, Walt notices a column of black smoke in the distance. The survivors then tell Rousseau about the hatch, and their need to open it. Rousseau offers to take them to the ""Black Rock"", where she says they can find dynamite. Jack runs into Sawyer in the jungle, and hands him a pistol with ammo ""just in case"". They share an awkward, distant goodbye. As Jack leaves, Sawyer stops him and tells him of when he met a man named Christian (John Terry) (Jack's father) in a bar in Sydney. He tells Jack what Christian said about his son, and Jack is visibly moved. Jack moves off into the jungle to find explosives. As Jack, Kate, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Dr. Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) head toward the Black Rock, Arzt is chased by The Monster, which Rousseau says is a security system protecting the island. As the raft prepares for launch, Sayid gives the team a radar emitter and flare gun, while Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) gathers messages from the remaining castaways to put in a bottle, and Walt leaves Vincent with Shannon. Sun says goodbye to Jin, handing him a notebook of phonetically written English terms to help him communicate with the others. This encourages him to speak to her and they reconcile. He says that he will still go, but because he wants to rescue her from the island. After all the goodbyes, the raft team sets off, while in the distance, the column of smoke continues to rise. Following Sun's flashback from the previous episode, Jin goes to the bathroom, he encounters a Caucasian man (John Walcutt) who reveals, in Korean, that he works for Sun's father, and knows that Jin was attempting to run away with Sun. He tells Jin to complete his delivery of a watch to Sun's father's friend in California and says he will never be free. In his hotel room, Charlie attempts to find his drugs. A girl (Terasa Livingstone), whom he has obviously slept with, asks if he has any left. He lies and says that he's run out, but she realizes that he's lying and attacks him for the drugs. Michael and Walt wait in the airport for their flight. Michael calls his mother and asks if she can take care of Walt, eventually even offering to pay her. Walt appears to overhear part of the conversation while asking Michael for batteries for his video game. Hurley awakens late for his flight due to a short-circuit in the wall outlet that leaves his alarm clock without power. In a mad dash for the airport, he experiences several problems, including a flat tire and arriving at the domestic terminal rather than international; he manages to get to the terminal just as they are closing the gate. The boarding agent is able to get them to reopen the doors for him, and he hugs her. Airline staff tell Locke that the wheelchair that is normally used to load disabled passengers on to the plane is missing, and he must be carried on by two attendants. When he drops a pamphlet from his seat, he is unable to reach it, but struggles to maintain his dignity. The final flashback is a montage that shows the group of strangers boarding the plane. Claire struggles in the aisle to get to her seat. Kate is led in handcuffs onto the plane. Sawyer searches for his seat as Charlie stores away his guitar. Jack puts his luggage into the overhead compartment, with Locke watching right behind him. Sun sits quietly with Jin, who is staring at the watch. Sayid endures the subtle racism of a fellow passenger sitting near him by looking at pictures of his lost love (Andrea Gabriel). Michael fastens the seatbelt of Walt as he plays Game Boy Advance SP, ignoring his father. Shannon frantically searches for her inhaler in her purse, but Boone gives it to her, causing her to smile. Hurley makes it on to the plane, giving Walt a thumbs-up before sitting down. Arzt helps Claire put her bag in the overhead compartment. Finally, Jack, about to sit down, catches Locke's eye, and the two politely acknowledge each other, unaware of what awaits them. The Black Rock is revealed to be the hull of a Portsmouth-registered wooden sailing ship, marooned in the jungle.

"Man of Science, Man of Faith",2,1,Jack Bender,Damon Lindelof,Jack,2005-09-21,23.47,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_Science,_Man_of_Faith","""Man of Science, Man of Faith"" is the first episode of the second season of Lost and the 26th episode overall. The episode was directed by Jack Bender and written by Damon Lindelof. It first aired on September 21, 2005, on ABC. The flashbacks focus on Jack Shephard's struggle to heal Sarah, who would later become his wife. In real time, John Locke and Kate Austen decide to enter the now-open hatch shaft. While writing the season premiere, the producers decided to pick up the hatch storyline which was left hanging after season one's finale ""Exodus"", leaving the raft events to be explained in the following episode, ""Adrift"". ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"" received positive reviews, and stands as the most-watched episode of the series in North America, with 23.47 million viewers. A man (Henry Ian Cusick) wakes up from his bunk bed and immediately presses a few keys on what appears to be a late 1970s-era computer. He then gets dressed, and begins his day as the camera moves about the surrounding rooms, which contain an assortment of objects from the 1960s to the present. He puts on some music, begins an exercise routine, has a shower, makes himself some breakfast, and injects himself with a vaccine. He is interrupted by an explosion, spurring the man to arm himself before using a telescope-and-mirror system. His gaze reveals the faces of Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) standing around the now-open Hatch shaft. Jack encounters his future wife, Sarah (Julie Bowen), who has arrived in his emergency room after a car crash. Jack saves Sarah's life, but goes on to tell her that due to spinal cord injury, it is unlikely that Sarah will regain the ability to walk. After being chastised by his father (John Terry) about his pessimistic bedside manner, Jack operates on Sarah, and goes running a tour de stade. While running he falls, and meets another runner named Desmond, who tells him that he is training for a race around the world. Jack shares with Desmond how he failed Sarah, and Desmond advises him about his need to feel and provide more hope. When Jack returns to Sarah's room, he discovers that she has experienced a miraculous recovery. At the Hatch entry, Locke says that they should not wait for the sun to come up to enter the Hatch. Jack, on the other hand, feels that their entry should be delayed. At the same time, at the caves, Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) search the jungle for Walt's (Malcolm David Kelley) dog, Vincent. During the search, Shannon has a vision of Walt, dripping wet and speaking incoherently. She talks about this with the rest of the survivors, but no one believes her. Upon reaching the caves, Jack explains the situation to the survivors, promising them they will be all right along with Kate, as long as they stay together. Locke then appears, carrying cable and saying he is going into the hatch. Soon after, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) follows behind him. While Locke is easing her down the shaft, Kate mysteriously disappears during a sudden burst of light from within the Hatch. Back at the caves, after informing the survivors why they went into the jungle and that Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) is dead, Jack decides that he is going after Kate and Locke. Upon reaching the Hatch, he finds no one there and rappels down the shaft on his own. While exploring, he comes across a painted mural, and a wall where the key hanging around his neck is pulled by a strong magnetic force. Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack not to touch it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot Locke if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting Locke about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond. While ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"" alludes to a quote in the previous episode where Locke describes himself as a man of faith and Jack as a man of science, writer Damon Lindelof stated that the episode has the title to imply that Jack is both, with the flashback making the empiricist ""man of science"" facing a miracle while treating a patient. The episode was written to focus on the opening of the hatch, so the other cliffhanger left in ""Exodus"", the destruction of Michael's boat and the kidnapping of his son Walt by the Others, would be explained in the second episode, ""Adrift"". The cliffhanger also influenced the tone: the protagonists are expecting an attack by the Others, but the audience knows the Others are not coming since they were going for the boat instead. To make the episode accessible to new viewers, many instances of dialogue recap events of the first season.[2] The producers decided to start the episode inside The Swan because they considered the audience would expect to pick up from Locke and Jack looking into the hatch shaft, so the opening instead is filmed in a place that does not reveal its location or period - director Jack Bender stated it made him remember a San Francisco apartment - until the explosion of the hatch. For the flashbacks, Bender decided to avoid making the hospital scenes similar to ER, filming mostly with handheld cameras to give a ""spontaneous feel"" to the scene. Sarah's operation was filmed in an actual surgery room in Oahu,[2] while Aloha Stadium in Honolulu is used for Jack and Desmond's tour de stade.[3] Starting in this episode, the castaways start abandoning the caves, which the producers considered a location hard to film and ""not aesthetically good"". The Swan would become a centerpiece location because of its mysteries and the commodities given to the protagonists, such as electricity and food.[2] The station was designed to invoke modernism of the 1970s, similar to how Disneyland's Tomorrowland evokes what was modern in the 1960s, but with an appearance that decayed after decades without maintenance.[4] Foreshadowing the fact that the station is used for dangerous means, the design added the concrete wall with a magnetic force. The hatch shaft was completely computer generated with shots filmed using a greenscreen.[2] This is the first episode to feature the song ""Make Your Own Kind of Music"" by Mama Cass, which is heard in many later episodes. Lindelof picked the song as it reminded him of his childhood, as his mother ""used to listen to on Sunday mornings, when she’d put on music, vacuum and cry.""[2] Lindelof also declared that the song ""lyrically felt right"", and had a haunting feeling due to Mama Cass' personal history.[5] The season premiere hit a ratings high for the series, with 23.47 million American viewers.[6] The episode was third in the weekly audience ranking, behind CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and Desperate Housewives,[7] and stands as the most watched episode of Lost.[8] Critical reviews were positive. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly was frustrated at the episode not revealing what happened to the raft characters and unveiling of so many new mysteries, but liked the writing and symbolism considering that ""the whole enigmatic enterprise seemed grounded in rich layers of meaning"".[9]TV Squad's Keith McDuffee said he was ""held in suspense"" throughout the episode.[10] Chris Carabott of IGN rated ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"" 9.3 out of 10, praising the flashbacks for being ""edited incredibly well with the on island content"" and Julie Bowen's performance as Sarah.[11]The Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan described the episode as ""a wonderfully paced, terrific return to form"".[12] Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it considered the introduction in the hatch and Desmond's scene with Jack at the stadium to be the highlights of the season premiere.[13] Director of photography Michael Bonvillain was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series for this episode.[14]IGN ranked ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"" the 18th best episode of Lost,[15] while a similar list by Los Angeles Times ranked the episode 11th, saying it had the best Jack flashback and demonstrated ""a show confident in itself and at the height of its powers"".[16]",6048,9.1
Adrift,2,2,Stephen Williams,Steven Maeda & Leonard Dick,Michael,2005-09-28,23.17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrift_(Lost),"""Adrift"" is the second episode of the second season of Lost and the 27th episode overall. The episode was directed by Stephen Williams and written by Steven Maeda and Leonard Dick. It first aired on September 28, 2005, on the American Broadcasting Company. In the episode, flashbacks depict Michael Dawson's struggles for the custody of his son Walt Lloyd. The realtime events show Michael and Sawyer, who have just had their raft destroyed, becoming hostile towards each other as they drift back to shore, while Kate Austen and John Locke enter the mysterious hatch and encounter Desmond Hume. The storyline picks up the raft storyline which was left hanging after season one's finale, ""Exodus"", and also revisits the events seen in the previous episode, ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"". Originally envisioned as a Sawyer episode, the episode was rewritten to focus on Michael. The sea scenes were shot on the Hawaiian shoreline. ""Adrift"" had 23.17 million American viewers and stands as the second largest audience on the series' run, but received negative reviews, which focused criticism on the flashbacks, the raft scenes, and the lack of plot advancement. In the flashbacks, Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) struggles with his ex-girlfriend Susan Lloyd (Tamara Taylor), who has asked Michael to sign away his paternal rights to their son, Walt. Although Michael initially resists, suing in order to keep his custody, he eventually relents as Susan persuades him to doubt his own motivations and whether he is pursuing his own desires or Walt's best interests. After the raft was attacked and destroyed by the Others, Sawyer (Josh Holloway) surfaces in the ocean. Michael is heard screaming for Walt repeatedly, and Sawyer screams for Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). Sawyer decides to rescue Michael first, and swims over to him, dragging him onto a piece of flotsam and performing CPR. Michael then wakes up, and blames Sawyer for making him fire the flare, drawing their attackers to them. Shortly after, the two notice a shark is encircling them; Michael believes the shark was attracted to Sawyer's bleeding wound, and the two have continuous arguments. Back at camp, after Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) disappears into the hatch, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) descends as well, and finds her unconscious in the computer room. An armed Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) walks up behind them, and asks Locke if he is ""him"". Locke at first claims to be the person whom Desmond is seeking, but fails to correctly answer a riddle he poses. This failure prompts Desmond to round up the two and orders Kate to tie up Locke. However, Locke convinces Desmond that Kate be tied up instead. Desmond agrees, and Locke slides her a knife before locking her in a dark room. Kate frees herself and finds she is in a large pantry filled with foodstuffs, all in boxes bearing a strange marking. Kate then climbs into a ventilation shaft while Desmond interrogates Locke about the outside world and finds out about the plane crash. The plotline converges to the same point at the end of the previous episode, ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"". An alarm klaxon begins to sound. Desmond walks Locke at gunpoint to the computer terminal, and forces him to enter ""the numbers"" into the computer, which resets a 108 minute timer. Soon after, Desmond detects Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), and after channeling him to the computer room, forces Locke to greet Jack as seen in the previous episode. Back at the raft, Michael and Sawyer see one of the raft's pontoons, and they decide to board it. Sawyer swims to the pontoon, giving Michael his gun in case the shark appears. When it does, Michael fires several times, apparently injuring the shark. Michael then joins Sawyer on the pontoon, and when the morning breaks, he cries, realizing that he should not have brought Walt with him on the raft, and blames himself for his son's kidnapping. At this point, Sawyer notices that they are back near the island. When they wash ashore, they meet Jin running toward them, hands tied behind his back, shouting the word ""Others"", and fleeing a group holding him captive. Season one's final episode finishes with two cliffhangers, the opening of the hatch and the attack of the Others on Michael's boat. When production of season 2 started, the writers decided that season premiere ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"" would focus on the hatch, leaving the raft for the second episode. To avoid bloating the first episode, some of the hatch storylines, such as Locke's incursion, were left to be revealed in ""Adrift"".[3] The episode was originally going to be Sawyer centric, and was to feature actress Jolene Blalock as a guest,[4] but this was rewritten ""at the proverbial last minute"" and changed to a Michael-centric episode.[5] Director Stephen Williams described filming at the sea as challenging, since the waves caused cameras, lighting and the scenery where the actors were standing to be ""moving out of sync with one another"". Williams however thought that the scenes became more realistic due to the location. The aquatic scenes took three nights to complete, and Harold Perrineau received swimming lessons in preparation.[6] When Sawyer is getting ready to swim to the other platform, a shark swims past, and in an underwater shot a DHARMA Initiative insignia can briefly be seen near its back fin. This was an inside joke or ""easter egg,"" which turned out to be more visible than had been intended.[6] While a mechanical shark which required three puppeteers was built, the shot of Michael being attacked was done with a shark fin being held by an underwater crew member.[2] 23.17 million American viewers tuned into ""Adrift"", making it the second most-watched episode in the show's history, behind the season opener.[7][8] Reviews were mostly negative. Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com said the flashback storyline ""wasn't all that interesting"".[9]Entertainment Weekly's Jeff Jensen called the flashbacks ""among the poorest and most clumsily integrated flashbacks we've seen so far"", as he felt nothing new was learned, and also disliked Michael's on-Island storyline, noting he ""got the sense that the actors and directors weren't quite sure what to make of these scenes"". Jensen however complimented the Hatch scenes, considering that Terry O'Quinn's performance and his interaction with Henry Ian Cusick were ""salvaging the first mediocre episode of the season"".[10] Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it thought that revealing the Hatch events through different perspectives a ""fresh narrative approach"", but complained about the lack of plot advancement, and considered the raft storyline ""three times as long as needed, with a really fake shark attack to boot"".[11]IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10, praising Perrineau's performance and the flashback,[12] but the website later ranked ""Adrift"" 80th out of the 115 Lost episodes, jokingly saying that the shark should have eaten Michael ""and save us a lot of 'Waaaaaalt!' and 'They took him. From my hands!' shout fests"".[8] A similar list by Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the fourth worst of the series, describing it as ""boring"".[13]New York magazine listed ""Adrift"" in its ""Twenty Most Pointless Episodes of Lost"", complaining about ""grinding the story to a halt"" and the ""plodding"" flashback, and saying that the episode would have been improved if Sawyer and Michael reached land faster.[14]",4682,8.4
Orientation,2,3,Jack Bender,Javier Grillo-Marxuach & Craig Wright,Locke,2005-10-05,22.38,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(Lost),"""Orientation"" is the third episode of the second season of Lost and the 28th episode overall. The episode was directed by Jack Bender, and written by Javier Grillo-Marxuach and Craig Wright. It first aired on October 5, 2005, on ABC. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) learn about the mysterious hatch from Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick). On the other side of the island, Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) are imprisoned by people they believe to be the ""Others."" Locke is participating in a support group, where he emotionally recounts the deception perpetrated by his father. Afterwards, a group member, Helen Norwood (Katey Sagal), approaches him in sympathy, and they become romantically involved. After spending the night together, Helen wakes up to find Locke getting dressed, claiming he is uncomfortable sleeping in an unfamiliar bed. He goes out to sit in his car outside his father's (Kevin Tighe) estate. His father confronts him, saying he knows that Locke has been stalking him, and tells him that he's not wanted. To celebrate six months together, Helen gives Locke a present: her house key, under the condition that he stop going to his father's house. Locke agrees, but is unable to keep his word. Helen eventually follows and confronts him. She says he is afraid of moving past what his father has done, and of moving forward with her. She tells him it is meant to be difficult, because what she is asking from him is a leap of faith. At the underground compound, the confrontation between Jack, Desmond and Locke provides enough of a distraction for Kate to knock Desmond down. However, he gets off a shot, which damages the computer. Desmond claims that everyone will die unless the computer is fixed. Kate heads off to fetch Sayid via an alternate exit. Desmond explains that three years earlier, his boat crashed on the island. He then met a man who enlisted his help in his sole duty: entering a code into the computer every 108 minutes (notably, 108 is the sum of the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42). Desmond claims that ""the end of the world"" will come if the button is not pressed. He directs Jack and Locke to watch a short orientation film from 1980 , narrated by a scientist named Dr. Marvin Candle (François Chau).Candle describes a multi-research project created in 1970 by Gerald and Karen DeGroot and funded by Alvar Hanso, called the DHARMA Initiative and states the name and rough purpose of the hatch as an electromagnetic research station of DHARMA called ""The Swan"", the third of six similar stations built by them. He explains that shortly after the hatch was built, there was an incident .The viewers must enter the code into the computer every 108 minutes, specifically at the 4 minute mark on the timer, to prevent that incident from happening again. Candle also warns the viewers about using the computer for anything else but the film suddenly cuts to him wishing good luck. Jack believes that all this is just a social experiment, but Locke feels the film should be taken at its word. Desmond attempts to power up the computer, without success. He panics and leaves. Jack runs after Desmond in the woods. Desmond recognizes him as a man whom he met in a stadium, and asks what happened to the girl Jack was operating on. Jack, upset, answers that he married her - but he's not married anymore. Desmond leaves, and Jack returns to the compound. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) successfully repairs the computer. Locke tells Jack he should be the one to hit the button, but Jack refuses. As the alarms sound, Locke asks Jack why it is so hard to believe, and Jack asks Locke why he finds it so easy. Locke tells him it was never easy, but that Jack needs to make a leap of faith of his own. With one second to spare, Jack presses the button. The timer resets. On the beach, Michael and Sawyer discover Jin, being chased by five people whom Jin identifies as the Others. The three are knocked unconscious and thrown into a pit. Another prisoner (Michelle Rodriguez) is later dropped into the pit. She introduces herself as Ana Lucia Cortez, another survivor of Oceanic Flight 815. Ana Lucia was in the tail section, which crashed on the opposite side of the island from the fuselage. Sawyer tells her that he plans to shoot the guard the next time he appears. Ana Lucia suddenly grabs Sawyer's gun and calls for the guard (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), revealing herself to have been planted in the pit to gain information from the prisoners. The writing team was afraid that the hatch scenes would be heavy on exposition and drag on. The solution they found was shooting the computer, which would create a crisis and tension as the device needed to be repaired in 108 minutes, and also allow for new information to be given ""on the fly"".[2] This episode marks the first appearance of series regular Mr. Eko, played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, where he was only shown briefly, knocking down three of the show's main characters with a stick. Akinnuoye-Agbaje was given the stick and told to ""Knock those three guys out"". Akinnuoye-Agbaje felt that ""there's no better way to make an entrance"".[3] 22.38 million American viewers watched this episode when it originally aired.[4]",4895,8.7
Everybody Hates Hugo,2,4,Alan Taylor,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Hurley,2005-10-12,21.66,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Hates_Hugo,"""Everybody Hates Hugo"" is the fourth episode of the second season of the American drama television series Lost, and the show's 29th episode overall. The episode was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, and directed by Alan Taylor. It first aired in the United States on October 12, 2005, on ABC. In this episode, flashbacks reveal why Hurley is hesitant at his new job of distributing food found in the newly discovered Swan station. Meanwhile, a few castaways become worried that the raft sent by them for rescue may have not gone as far as they hoped. Jack and Sayid explore the hatch, while Sawyer, Jin, and Michael find out that their captors are from the tail section of the plane. Following Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes's (Jorge Garcia) discovery of his winning lottery numbers. Hurley keeps his win a secret, and quits his job at a fast food restaurant along with his friend Johnny (DJ Qualls). The pair enjoy themselves by pulling a prank on their former boss, and going to a record store where Hurley asks out his crush, Starla (Marguerite Moreau). Hurley asks Johnny to promise that they will never change, and Johnny does so. Johnny pulls into a local gas station to buy some beer, but notices news crews talking to the attendant. When the clerk loudly points out Hurley as the buyer of the winning lottery ticket, Johnny's stunned expression clearly reveals that, despite his promise, everything has changed. In the Swan station, Hurley struggles with the task of food rationing. Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) asks Hurley if the bunker contains food, specifically peanut butter for Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), but Hurley will not answer him. Hurley decides to enlist Rose Henderson-Nadler (L. Scott Caldwell) to help him take inventory. At one point, Hurley has a strange dream, in which Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) tells Hurley, in English, that ""everything is going to change."" Hurley becomes less and less certain of his ability to ration the food in a manner that keeps everyone happy. He attempts to quit, but John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) refuses to permit it. Hurley then prepares to blow up the pantry with dynamite, but Rose intervenes. He explains that the food, newfound wealth to the survivors, will change everything and everyone will come to hate him, just as things changed when everyone knew he won the lottery; however Rose talks him out of his plan. Later, Hurley informs Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) of his decision to give all the food away, arguing that the food stores do not amount to very much when divided among all the survivors. The food is distributed freely and the survivors enjoy a feast. Everyone appreciates Hurley's decision, including Charlie, who gives his benefactor a hug of reconciliation. James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) and Jin learn that their captors are survivors from the tail section of Oceanic 815 and are taken to a DHARMA Initiative station, which they use for sanctuary. A woman named Libby (Cynthia Watros) says that there were 23 survivors from the tail section of the plane, although very few remain. Meanwhile, the bottle of messages from the raft, on which Michael, Sawyer, Jin and Walt Lloyd were travelling, washes ashore. Claire and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) give it to Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Jin's wife, and she opts to bury the bottle on the beach. In the hatch, Jack and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) inspect the mysterious concrete barricade blocking what appears to be a corridor to another section of the bunker. They discover that the barrier is very thick and that the corridor is also blocked on the foundation level. Later, Jack and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) share a moment of sexual tension when she exits the shower wearing only a towel. ""Everybody Hates Hugo"" was the only episode of the series directed by Alan Taylor. Taylor had previously directed episodes of The Sopranos and Sex and the City. The episode was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, the pair had previously written the episode ""Born to Run"". The character of Libby, played by Cynthia Watros, was introduced in this episode. Originally, Libby had been written to be in her late 40s or early 50s.[3]Jennifer Jason Leigh was approached to play the part, but it went to Watros instead.[4] When Watros auditioned for the part of Libby, she did not think that she would end up being cast. Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience.[5] They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard.[6]L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked.[5] This was the first time in which Raj K. Bose, who played the shop clerk, was credited. Bose had been a background actor on the series, playing a crash survivor and a flight attendant. Bose was originally cast to play the role of Sanjay in the first season episode ""Born to Run"", but was forced to give up the role after he had to teach a marketing class at the University of Phoenix. Casting agent Margaret Doversola later asked Bose to audition for the part of the shop clerk and he got the part.[citation needed] For the flashback scene at the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew was able to get the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. According to the Nielsen ratings system, ""Everybody Hates Hugo"" was viewed by an average of 21.7 million viewers. The episode achieved a 9.4/22 in the key 18–49 demographic, meaning that 9.4% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watched the episode, along with 22% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. ""Everybody Hates Hugo"" was the most watched episode of the night for the fourth week in a row, and the second most watched episode of the week. It also performed better than the previous episode in the key 18–49 demographic, and earned its second highest ever rating among teens 12-17.[7] Film Fodder's Mac Slocum said that he was glad that the show ""downshifted this week into a far more reasonable gear"". He felt that an upside to the downshifting was the ""return to characters"", and thought that there was no better representation of character than Hurley.[8] Keith McDuffee of TV Squad wrote that although he heard ""that this episode would be mostly filler"", he did not ""think that's true"". He liked the fact that there was more revelations of Hurley's background, and enjoyed the ""awesome reveals from the other half of downed Oceanic 815"".[9]TelevisionWithoutPity.com graded the episode with a ""B-"".[10]",4711,8.3
...And Found,2,5,Stephen Williams,Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof,Sun & Jin,2005-10-19,21.38,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...And_Found,"""...And Found"" is the fifth episode of the second season of Lost, and the 30th episode overall. The episode was directed by Stephen Williams, and written by Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof. It first aired on October 19, 2005, on ABC. Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) searches for her missing wedding ring; meanwhile, Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) conducts a solitary search for his kidnapped son. The characters of Sun and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) are featured in the episode's flashbacks. Sun is in South Korea, set up on a date by a matchmaker, and finds her prospective suitor, Jae Lee, to be wealthy, educated, and charming. Meanwhile, Jin is preparing for an important job interview at a hotel. His roommate, using what appears to be the I Ching, tells him that Jin will find love soon, adding cryptically that its color will be orange. Jin's interviewer, Mr. Kim, berates Jin as a bumpkin villager who stinks of fish, but then hires him as a doorman anyway, with a stern warning that Jin is not to open the door to anyone like himself. Sun and Jae continue to hit it off, and the pair schedule a meeting at the hotel where Jin is working and which Jae's family owns. Sun heads for the entrance of the hotel, but Jin fails to see her because he is bowing as he opens the door for her. Inside, Jae suddenly reveals that he plans to marry a woman he met in America, and has been seeing Sun only to placate his parents. Although she is obviously disappointed, Sun wishes him well and leaves. A poorly dressed father with a young boy approaches the hotel, and asks Jin for permission to enter, as the boy urgently has to go to the bathroom. Jin reluctantly lets the pair inside, but Mr. Kim observes this, and gives him a stern dressing-down, again insulting his background. Jin quits on the spot. Later, wandering along a bridge, Jin passes a woman in an orange dress. Looking back wistfully, he shakes his head in amusement, and turns around. He collides directly with Sun, thus meeting his future wife for the first time. At the beach, Sun has discovered that she has lost her wedding ring. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) offers to help Sun look for the ring, which Sun declines. Later, when Sun is angrily tearing apart her garden, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) arrives. Sun states that she does not remember ever seeing him angry. Locke laughs and replies that he used to be angry often. Sun asks him why he no longer becomes angry, and he replies that he is not lost any more. Sun asks him how he found himself. Locke answers, ""The same way anything lost gets found: I stopped looking."" When Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) tries to console her, Sun reveals that the message bottle had been recovered, and tells her that she has buried it. Upon digging up the bottle, Kate becomes upset and frantically attempts to read all of the messages. Sun stops her and says that the messages are private. Kate tells Sun that she never said goodbye to James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway). Kate then glances at the sand and tells Sun to look down – Sun finds her wedding ring lying in the sand. Jin, Michael, Sawyer and the survivors of the tail section, Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Libby Smith (Cynthia Watros), Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) and Cindy Chandler (Kimberley Joseph) decide to trek back to the safer side of the island. Michael, however, abruptly leaves to look for Walt (Malcolm David Kelley). Jin and Eko set off after Michael while the remaining survivors head for the other side of the island. As they track Michael, Jin encounters a charging wild boar, and rolls down an escarpment. When he lands, he sees the body of another survivor (Brett Cullen), with a weapon still protruding from his chest. Eko informs Jin the man's name was ""Goodwin."" Jin then says ""Others?"" and Eko nods. Eko picks up fresh tracks and tells Jin that it must be Michael. Moments later, Eko senses someone coming. As he and Jin hide, they see a procession of people go by in silence. The Others are seen only from the thighs down, all barefoot, all muddy, and the last is carrying a brown teddy bear on a cord. Later, the two find Michael. Eko successfully convinces him to go back, saying that the Others will not be found unless they want to be. The episode gained 21.38 million American viewers.[1]",4553,7.9
Abandoned,2,6,Adam Davidson,Elizabeth Sarnoff,Shannon,2005-11-09,20.01,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandoned_(Lost),"""Abandoned"" is the 31st episode of the television series Lost, and is the sixth episode of the second season. The episode was directed by Adam Davidson and written by Elizabeth Sarnoff. It first aired on November 9, 2005, on ABC. The character of Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. Shannon is teaching ballet. She receives a call that her father has been in an accident and goes to the hospital, where she finds that he has died in a car crash. Shannon's father is the ""Adam Rutherford"" struck by the SUV driven by Jack's future wife , Sarah,in ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"". Also there, rushing to perform surgery on Sarah, Jack is seen, but he does not speak or play an important role in the episode. At the funeral, her stepbrother Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) arrives to console her. Later, when Shannon wins a dance internship in New York City, she finds she cannot go because her stepmother, Sabrina (Lindsay Frost), will not allow her to use any of her father's money. She pleads with her stepmother, who rebuffs her, suggesting her dream of becoming a dancer is just a passing whim, and that Shannon needs to make her own way. Boone attempts to help, but is unsuccessful in convincing his mother. When Shannon asks if she can stay in New York with him, he tells her that he is leaving the city to take a job working for his mother. He offers her money, but she angrily rejects it, telling him that if he doesn't believe she can make it on her own, she doesn't want his help. On the far side of the Island, Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) reunite with Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson), Libby Smith (Cynthia Watros) and Cindy Chandler (Kimberley Joseph). The eight leave for the camp made by the survivors of the midsection of the plane. Along the way, Sawyer collapses from infection; when Michael goes to assist him, Sawyer tells him to leave him behind and that if their positions were reversed, he would leave Michael. The survivors make a stretcher and carry Sawyer, though their journey will be considerably slowed. After an arduous battle to carry him up a hill, they look around and notice that Cindy has vanished. Immediately after, the seven hear whispering coming from all around. Sayid and Shannon make love. Shannon is then horrified when she sees Walt standing in the tent saturated from head to toe. Shannon tells Sayid and he doesn't believe her, saying that it was probably just a bad dream. Shannon is convinced it's her destiny to find Walt, as she thinks he is all alone. Shannon leads Vincent the dog to Michael and Walt Lloyd's (Malcolm David Kelley) tent and shows him some of Walt's clothes, then follows as the dog searches for his master. Vincent leads Shannon to Boone's makeshift grave, where she stops to reflect. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) finds her and asks what she is doing. She tells him she's going to find Walt and gets up to continue following Vincent. Sayid comes along, protesting. Shannon yells at Sayid, telling him that he does not believe in her and is going to abandon her. Sayid tells her that he loves her and will never leave her. The pair embrace, then suddenly hear whispering; they look up and see Walt, who gestures them to remain silent. Shannon dashes after Walt and Sayid follows her until he trips. A gunshot is heard and Shannon is seen staggering back towards Sayid, who catches her as she collapses, bleeding from the torso. The camera pans back to reveal Ana Lucia with a smoking gun, and the episode ends with a view of a devastated Sayid holding Shannon's body. Malcolm David Kelley (Walt) is credited with the starring cast for this episode. This episode marks main character Shannon Rutherford's death. She was the first main character to die in this season and second main character overall. Despite this, Maggie Grace is still credited as a series regular in the next episode and a special guest star onwards. Approximately 20,010,000 viewers watched the episode when it first aired.[2] Virginia Rohan of The Seattle Times thought the ""death of troubled Shannon, just as she was becoming more likable and had found love with Sayid, was sadder than the first-season death of her stepbrother, Boone. Still, it would grieve me far more to lose Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Locke, Sun or Jin"".[3] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune felt fans echoed this view, describing their reaction as ""muted"", as they were more angry at Ana Lucia for shooting Shannon.[4]IGN ranked Shannon's death as the show's fifth-best death.[5]",4541,8.3
The Other 48 Days,2,7,Eric Laneuville,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,Ana Lucia & Bernard & Libby & Mr. Eko,2005-11-16,21.87,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_48_Days,"""The Other 48 Days"" is the seventh episode of the second season of the American drama television series Lost, and the 32nd episode overall. The episode was directed by Eric Laneuville, and written by executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. It first aired on ABC in the United States on November 16, 2005. Unlike in previous episodes, where the flashbacks focused on events leading up to the crash, ""The Other 48 Days"" centers around the backstory of the tail-section characters, showing the events leading up to ""Abandoned"". The episode was seen by an estimated 21.87 million American household viewers. After the tail section of the plane crashes into the water off the beach, the survivors swim ashore. Mr. Eko pulls a young girl (Emma) out of the water, and Ana Lucia Cortez performs CPR on her, saving her life. Ana and Eko then go to aid more people, leaving the girl and her brother in the care of Cindy Chandler. Libby helps a man, later to be identified as Donald, by setting his broken leg. A man runs out of the jungle asking for help, saying there's someone alive in the jungle. The man, ""Goodwin"", brings Ana to Bernard, who is still belted into his airplane seat, stuck up in a tree. Ana coaxes him to grab the tree branch, just before the seat crashes to the ground. Back on the beach, Goodwin, who claims to be in the Peace Corps, builds a signal fire. That night, three of the adults are taken and Eko kills two of the ""Others"" with a rock when they try to take him. From that night on, he refuses to speak. Despite this incident, nobody organizes shifts to guard the group. Three survivors die from injuries on the second through fourth day. A survivor who identifies himself as Nathan suggests staying on the beach, and the group does so. On the fifth day, Donald dies from the leg injury and is buried. On the twelfth day, the Others take nine more, including Emma and her brother Zack; Zack is shown holding a teddy bear in this episode, and this shows that he is the boy Mr. Eko and Jin saw when they hid from the Others in ...And Found (they observed that same teddy bear). Ana manages to kill another one, who is discovered to be carrying an antique United States Army knife and a list of the nine to be taken, along with their descriptions. While trying to sort out what happened, the notion of an infiltrator in their midst is discussed, as well as a proposal to leave the beach. The survivors opt to head into the jungle. They make a camp near a source of fresh water and fruit trees. Ana digs a pit, which she turns into a cage. As soon as it is done, she knocks Nathan unconscious and throws him into the pit. She interrogates him, believing he is one of those who took the children, due to his unexplained absences and how nobody remembered seeing him on the plane. When asked where he came from, he replies Canada (this is the same country that Ethan Rom, another member of the Others who antagonized Jack's group during season one, claimed to hail from). She begins starving him, demanding to know the location of the children, but Mr. Eko feeds him when she is not looking. Ana tells Goodwin she intends to start torturing Nathan the next day. That night, Goodwin frees Nathan, warning him of Ana's plan; when Nathan turns to leave, Goodwin breaks his neck, revealing to the viewers that he is the infiltrator. The survivors move again and find a bunker marked by a DHARMA Initiative logo, with an arrow in the center. Inside a box they find a glass eye, a Bible and a radio. Goodwin and Ana go to higher ground to try to pick up a signal. While there, Ana reveals that she knows Goodwin is one of the Others, because on the first day, he ran out of the jungle with his clothes completely dry, ten minutes after the plane crashed into the water. Goodwin admits he killed Nathan, saying that he thought that if Ana tortured him and he didn't say anything, than Ana might view Nathan as innocent, and thus he'd no longer be a scapegoat. Goodwin comments that those taken were ""good people"", and that Nathan was not on the list because he was ""not a good person"", and states that the children are fine but doesn't elaborate on where they or any of the other captives are. The two fight; when they roll down a hill, Ana impales him on a sharpened stick (Goodwin's impaled body was seen by Jin and Eko two episodes earlier and when Jin asked if he was killed by the Others, Eko misunderstands him as asking if he was one of the Others). Ana returns to the survivors and tells them, ""We're safe here now"". On the forty-first day, Bernard picks up Boone on the radio, and responds to Boone's ""We're the survivors of the crash of Oceanic Flight 815"" with ""We're the survivors of flight 815."" This shows the truth behind what Boone was hearing when he originally made the transmission in a previous episode from the first season. Before any further conversation can take place, Ana turns off the radio, dismissing the transmission as another trick by the Others. Bernard asks how they would know their flight number, but Ana points out that they would know since Goodwin knew, and tells them to accept that this is their new lives. She goes off by herself to cry, and Eko tells her everything will be all right. She tells him it took him forty days to speak; he tells her it took her forty days to cry. Soon after, Cindy and Libby find Jin washed up on the shore. After pulling him from the water, they tie him up and blindfold him while they try to find out who he is. As Eko and Ana Lucia argue, Jin breaks free and runs to the beach. The remainder of the episode is shown as a montage of the events already seen in the episodes ""Orientation"" through ""Abandoned"", including the tail-section survivors' acceptance of Jin, Sawyer and Michael, the trek to the midsection's camp, Sawyer falling ill, Cindy listening to the forest's whispers just before she is ""taken"", and the shooting of Shannon by Ana Lucia. The episode gained 21.87 million American viewers when it first aired.[2]",5335,8.8
Collision,2,8,Stephen Williams,Javier Grillo-Marxuach & Leonard Dick,Ana Lucia,2005-11-23,19.29,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(Lost),"""Collision"" is the 33rd episode of Lost and the eighth episode of the second season. The episode was directed by Stephen Williams, and written by Javier Grillo-Marxuach and Leonard Dick. It first aired on November 23, 2005, on ABC. The character of Ana Lucia Cortez is featured in the episode's flashbacks. Ana Lucia is a police officer in the Los Angeles Police Department, who was shot by a burglary suspect. After recovering, she has trouble dealing with the stress of the job. When she learns that the suspect who shot her, Jason McCormick, has been caught and has confessed, and all she needs to do is identify him, she takes a look, but says, ""It's not him,"" and he is released. She then follows him herself, and confronts him in a lonely parking lot. When she calls his name, he asks, ""I know you?"" at which point she states, ""I was pregnant,"" shoots him three times in the chest and then proceeds to shoot him three times again in the head. Realizing that Ana Lucia has shot Shannon, Sayid pulls his gun on her, but Eko knocks him down and struggles with him. During the fight, Ana Lucia knocks Sayid unconscious, and then forces Libby to tie him up with vines from Sawyer's stretcher. Eko then carries Sawyer to find medical attention from the main group of survivors. When the other tail-section survivors force Ana Lucia to tell them her plan to resolve the situation, she tells them that Michael must go back to the camp and return with ammunition, a pack, clothing, and food for Ana Lucia, who plans to survive on the island on her own. Michael leaves for the midsection survivor camp. Back at the hatch, after Jack brings down Sawyer's temperature using the hatch's shower, he tries to get Sawyer to swallow medication. When he can't do it, Kate offers to help. She embraces Sawyer and whispers on his ear slowly telling him he has to swallow the medicine to get better. Sawyer then swallows the pill. When Jack and Locke learn about what happened to Shannon and Sayid, they angrily demand that Eko guide them to the location, but Eko refuses, saying that, ""Ana Lucia made a mistake,"" and Jack recognizes her name as someone he had been conversing with before boarding Oceanic Flight 815. Michael returns and informs Jack about Ana Lucia's demands and Mr. Eko agrees to take Jack, only, back to Ana Lucia, as long as he agrees not to take any guns. After the other tail-section survivors, Libby and Bernard, leave Ana Lucia and follow Jin back to camp, Ana Lucia interrogates Sayid, asking him apparently odd questions such as whether or not he has any children. He asks her if she is going to kill him. Clearly experiencing mental anguish, he says perhaps she should kill him. Ana in response, relates her story, saying that when she was shot, all she heard was a pop and that by the time she hit the ground she thought she was dead. She tells him that she feels dead. When Sayid asks her what happened to the man who shot her, says that nothing happened to him, and that he was never found. She then frees Sayid with Eko's machete, drops her weapon, and dares Sayid to take his revenge. But Sayid refuses, saying, ""What good would it be to kill you, if we're both already dead?"" and walks over to Shannon's body. Eventually, the rest of the tail-section survivors and Jin make it back to the camp, where Bernard and Rose as well as Jin and Sun are finally reunited. The episode ends with Sayid carrying Shannon's body back to camp, and Ana Lucia and Jack, the two leaders of the survivor camps, facing each other for the first time after the crash. In her early appearances, Ana Lucia is shown to be very tough, so the flashbacks in ""Collision"", where it is revealed she lost her baby, were used to show a softer side to her.[2]L. Scott Caldwell and Sam Anderson, who play Rose and Bernard, deliberately did not meet before their reunion scene in ""Collision"" as they wanted it to be as authentic as possible.[3]Maggie Grace (Shannon) is no longer credited with the starring cast and is now credited as a ""special guest star"" when she appears. 19.29 million American viewers watched the episode live.[4]",4613,8.7
What Kate Did,2,9,Paul Edwards,Steven Maeda & Craig Wright,Kate,2005-11-30,21.54,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Kate_Did,"""What Kate Did"" is the 34th episode of Lost. It is the ninth episode of the second season. The episode was directed by Paul Edwards, and written by Steven Maeda and Craig Wright. It first aired on November 30, 2005, on ABC. The character of Kate Austen is featured in the episode's flashbacks. Kate Austen kills her alcoholic stepfather, Wayne Jansen, by blowing up his house. Kate confronts her mother, Diane Austen. Kate reveals that she took out an insurance policy under Diane's name. Later, Kate attempts to buy a ticket to Tallahassee, when she is arrested by United States Marshal Edward Mars, revealing that her mother had turned her in. On a country highway during a rainy night, Mars is driving a handcuffed Kate to her arraignment in Iowa. Suddenly, a black horse passes in front of the car, causing Mars to crash the car. With Mars momentarily stunned by the opening of the driver's airbag, Kate grabs the handcuff keys and escapes. Kate then visits a U.S. Army recruiting station and meets her father, Sergeant Major Sam Austen. As Kate approaches his desk, Sayid's arrest in the airport is shown on a television in the background. Kate tells Sam that she recently discovered that Wayne was her biological father. Sam reveals that he had known this all along but had hidden the truth because he feared Kate would kill Wayne if she ever found out. He informs Kate that he must call the authorities but agrees to give her a one-hour head start. In the Swan Station, Jack watches over Sawyer. Meanwhile, Kate is collecting fruit in the jungle. She is shocked to see a black horse standing in the undergrowth. She returns to the hatch to attend to Sawyer and the computer so that Jack can attend Shannon's funeral. At the funeral, Sayid tries to say a few words but, can only declare that he loved her before walking away. At the hatch, Kate tells an unconscious Sawyer that she saw a horse outside. Suddenly, Sawyer grabs her by the neck and says, ""You killed me. Why did you kill me?"" Jack and Locke later return to the hatch to find the alarm blaring, Sawyer on the floor, and Kate nowhere to be seen. In Swan Station, Michael asks Locke about the blast door in the ceiling, which Locke admits he had not noticed. Jack tracks Kate down and accosts her for leaving Swan Station. In the ensuing confrontation, Kate suddenly kisses Jack, however, she immediately runs away. Locke shows the DHARMA Initiative ""Orientation"" film of Swan Station to Michael and Eko and then explains that he has set up two-person shifts every six hours to enter the code. Sayid discovers Kate sitting at Shannon's grave. She apologizes for missing the funeral and confesses that she thinks she is going crazy, to which Sayid replies that he saw Walt in the jungle just before Shannon was shot and asks if that makes him crazy too. At Swan Station, Michael asks to inspect the equipment, and Locke agrees. Later, Eko calls Locke aside and, after leading in with a story about Josiah and the book found during Josiah's rule, reveals a hollowed-out Bible which contains a small reel of film, which was found by the tail-section survivors in the DHARMA Arrow Station. Locke unrolls part of the reel and recognizes Dr. Marvin Candle. Back in the hatch, Kate, believing that Wayne's ghost has somehow possessed Sawyer's body, confesses aloud that she killed him after finding out that he was her biological father. It was too much to bear for her to know that the man who she hated would always be a 'part of her'. Following Kate's confession, Sawyer awakes as his normal self, and his comments reveal he has heard the whole conversation. She shows Sawyer around the hatch before taking him outside. As the two talk, the black horse reappears. Sawyer reveals he can see the horse as well. Kate approaches and pets it, and after a moment, the horse walks back into the jungle. Eko and Locke splice the film from the book back into the main film reel. They watch the missing section of the film, in which Dr. Candle expands on his warning that the computer is to be used only to enter the code. He explains that while the isolation of the SWAN may tempt one to use the computer to communicate with the outside world, such action could lead to another ""incident."" While examining the computer equipment Michael hears a strange beeping from the computer. The phrase 'Hello?' appears, the computer seems to be receiving messages. When asked what his name is, Michael types his name on the screen, and there is a delayed response. The computer then responds 'Dad?' Hurley comments that he did not expect Rose's husband to be white, before Jack quickly changes the subject. The producers felt it was important to address that they are an interracial couple, and that Hurley was saying what the audience would be thinking.[2] Caldwell agreed with them and thought it would be odd if the issue was not addressed.[2] Anderson also was glad that Hurley brought up the issue, and liked that Jack did not pay any attention.[2] The episode gained 21.54 million American viewers in its first airing.[3]",4543,8.3
The 23rd Psalm,2,10,Matt Earl Beesley,Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof,Mr. Eko,2006-01-11,20.56,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_23rd_Psalm,"""The 23rd Psalm"" is the tenth episode of the second season of Lost, and the 35th episode overall. The episode was directed by Matt Earl Beesley, and written by Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof. It first aired on January 11, 2006, on ABC, and was watched by an average of 20.56 million American viewers. The episode is centered on the character of Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), who in flashbacks is revealed to be a former warlord in Nigeria, and in the present day events goes with Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) to the Nigerian airplane which had crashed on the island. The episode has an overall theme of redemption, and was written by drawing inspiration from ""Deus Ex Machina"", the episode where the Nigerian airplane was first introduced. Reviews for ""The 23rd Psalm"" were positive, praising the flashback and Akinnuoye-Agbaje's performance as Eko. The episode's script was later nominated for an Emmy Award. Nigerian guerrillas arrive at a small village, grab a young boy named Yemi and try to force him to shoot an old man. The boy hesitates and his older brother, Eko, takes the gun and shoots the man himself, thus saving his brother from the act. The guerrillas are pleased with this, and force him to join their group, tearing his Christian cross from his neck, which is then taken by Yemi. Years later, Eko has become a powerful warlord. He meets with a drug dealer who is trying to get his heroin out of the country. Eko offers to do him a ""favor,"" buying the drugs at a low price and spiriting them out of the country. The drug runner agrees, but is killed after saying that he believed Eko had no soul. Later, Eko visits the church of his hometown, where Yemi has become a priest. Eko asks him for a plane, because only United Nations relief and missionary aircraft are allowed to fly out of Nigeria, saying he will fly the drugs away from the Nigerians and give his brother money for a polio vaccine. Yemi refuses to help. Later, Eko approaches his brother again, asking simply for Yemi to sign ordination papers that make Eko and two associates priests so that they can arrange the flight themselves. His brother refuses, but reluctantly signs after Eko says that his two friends will burn the church to the ground if Yemi does not collaborate. Eko also buys Virgin Mary statues to hide the heroin within. Dressed as priests, Eko and two associates are loading drugs onto a Beechcraft airplane, when Yemi drives up and tells him not to leave. The Nigerian military arrives shortly thereafter, killing a henchman and shooting Yemi. Eko loads his brother onto the plane, but the pilot, who has a gold tooth, prevents Eko from boarding and flies away. Then the military approach and, mistaking Eko for a real priest, ask Eko, ""Are you alright, Father?"" On the island, Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) watches Eko whittling scripture into the head of his club, and mentions that Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) carries a Virgin Mary statue. Eko immediately demands to see the statue, which he breaks open and shows Claire the heroin inside. Eko then goes to Charlie, demanding him to take him to the plane. Meanwhile, Locke teaches Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) how to use a gun, and Michael then asks Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) to have her shift at the hatch computer. At the computer, Michael continues his conversation with his son Walt (Malcolm David Kelley), which is interrupted by the arrival of Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), who remains unaware of it. On the way to the Beechcraft, Eko and Charlie find a parachute in a tree, which leads to the corpse of a Nigerian man dressed as a priest that Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) had previously found. When Eko sees the dead man's gold tooth, he tells Charlie that the man ""saved his life."" Charlie loses his way, and Mr. Eko tells him to climb a tree. As he is above the tree, trees are uprooted as a cloud of free-moving black smoke emerges from the jungle. It confronts Mr. Eko whilst flashing images to him of his past. Mr. Eko stands his ground, despite Charlie telling him to run, and stares at the smoke before it pulls back and disappears. (This scene is significant because it marks the first appearance of the smoke monster in the second season, and it is the first time a clear shot of it is given; apart from very brief glances in the season one finale, the monster went unseen throughout the entire first season.) Eko and Charlie then find the plane, inside which Eko finds another corpse which Eko recognizes as Yemi. After taking the cross from Yemi's body, Eko tells Charlie that it is his brother, gives Charlie a Virgin Mary statue ""for the one [he] broke"" and sets the plane on fire. Charlie asks Eko if he is a priest himself, and as Eko puts the cross around his neck he replies ""Yes, I am."" The two then recite Psalm 23 from the Old Testament as the plane burns. After arriving at the camp, Charlie apologizes to Claire, but Claire tells him to leave her and her son alone. Charlie then goes into the jungle, and opens a hiding place where he is keeping Virgin Mary statues to put with the one Eko gave him. During the production of ""Deus Ex Machina"", which introduced the Nigerian airplane, a corpse dressed as a priest with a gun, and Virgin Mary statues filled with heroin, the Lost writers decided that the story of the Beechcraft would coincide with one of the characters' flashbacks. They decided to use one of the tail section characters to be introduced in season 2, ""essentially a bad guy who was forced to disguise himself as a priest, and how would that come about, and could he now be presenting himself as a priest"".[2] Since Eko and Locke are both spiritual leaders on the island - but with Locke having a ""paganistic, ritualistic appreciation"" for the island's powers and Eko, ""pure religious faith"" - writers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof decided to write in this episode parallels with ""Deus Ex Machina"", where Locke and Boone find the Beechcraft.[3][4] The biggest similarity is Charlie unwillingly become Eko's ""acolyte"", just like Boone was being Locke's follower in their expedition to the airplane.[3] The main theme of ""The 23rd Psalm"" was redemption, which both Eko and Charlie are seeking, with Eko eventually getting his upon finding his brother. Charlie was chosen to be Eko's companion because the character did not have much screentime up to that point in the season, and the writers found similarities between Charlie and Eko, such as both having difficult relationships with their brothers. The writers accidentally transcribed Psalm 23 wrong, with ""the shadow of the valley of death"" instead of ""the valley of the shadow of death,"" but decided to keep the mistake, feeling it was appropriate as Eko was never a proper priest.[3] The flashbacks had the intent of showing that Eko was the opposite of his religious brother, but eventually ended up similar to Yemi.[3] Nigeria's depiction was described by art director Bill Matthews as a ""very dusty-dirty brown kind of Nigerian-earth look"", with touches such as vendors on the street, and a square where children play soccer. The interior of the church was an actual location in Haleiwa, and a facade was built on the set to match it.[4] While editing, the producers decided to separate a part of the final scene involving the airplane getting attacked and taking off, where a soldier confuses Eko for a priest, to juxtapose with Eko's spiritual epiphany on the island and set up his next flashback on ""?"", where he is a priest in Australia. As the casting team was having trouble finding a Moroccan to play the drug dealer, set caterer Moumen El Hajji was selected for the role.[3] As the Monster had not yet appeared in the second season, the producers decided to expand on his mythology in ""The 23rd Psalm"", as they thought Eko was a good character to confront the Monster because of his spirituality and ""self-awareness"". Visual effects supervisor Kevin Blank suggested on adding imagery representing Eko's past on the smoke, such as a cross and the man he shoots at the opening scene.[3] The original broadcast of ""The 23rd Psalm"" was on January 11, 2006 on ABC, being preceded by a clip show titled ""Lost: Revelations"".[5] It was watched by approximately 20.56 million American viewers, being third in the weekly audience ranking, behind the AFC playoffs and Desperate Housewives.[6] Reviews for ""The 23rd Psalm"" were mostly positive. Entertainment Weekly's Jeff Jensen gave the episode an A, describing it as a ""wonderfully strange parable about redemption and fate"".[7] Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com considered the episode a worthy return after the two-month break, saying that Eko's ""simple looks and simple phrases pummel the screen with gravitas and charisma"".[8] Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it considered highlights of the episode the scene with the Monster, and the flashback, which in his opinion ""[did] so great a job at explaining an entire character so succinctly"".[9]IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10, praising the development of Eko's character and the flashback.[10] Writers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof's script for ""The 23rd Psalm"" was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series.[11] IGN ranked ""The 23rd Psalm"" 40th out of the 115 Lost episodes, calling the flashback ""one of most action-packed and ambitious on the series"".[12] A similar list by Los Angeles Times ranked the episode at 49th, describing it as ""a great first chapter that sadly never got a worthy follow-up.""[13]",4781,8.7
The Hunting Party,2,11,Stephen Williams,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Christina M. Kim,Jack,2006-01-18,19.130000000000003,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunting_Party_(Lost),"""The Hunting Party"" is the 36th episode of Lost. It is the 11th episode of the second season. The episode was directed by Stephen Williams, and written by Elizabeth Sarnoff, and Christina M. Kim. It first aired on January 18, 2006, on ABC. The character of Jack Shephard is featured in the episode's flashbacks.[2] Jack Shephard and his father, Christian, discuss the effectiveness of surgery on an Italian man, Angelo Busoni, with a spinal tumor. Christian advises against the surgery. However, the man's daughter, Gabriela, tells Christian, ""We didn't come for you."" She and her father had read about the miraculous recovery of Jack's wife, and they hope that Jack can work another miracle. Jack agrees to operate, despite his father's disapproval. After one long night, Jack returns home to his wife, Sarah, who tells him that she has taken a pregnancy test after being late for her period; the test is negative. Later, when Gabriela is in Jack's office, signing release forms, Jack warns her of the risks of surgery, but she ultimately decides to proceed. Christian abruptly walks in on them as they share a quiet moment. When Gabriela leaves, Christian warns Jack about the dangers of getting too close to his patients. The surgery is not successful and Angelo dies on the operating table due to heart failure. Jack tells his father that he will break the news to Gabriela. Christian replies that he has already told the woman and she has left the hospital. Jack finds Gabriela in the parking lot, crying over her father's death. He tries to console her, and the two end up kissing. Jack pulls away and leaves, telling Gabriela that ""[he] can't"". At home, Jack confesses to his wife that he kissed another woman, but promises that he will change. As he holds her, Sarah pulls away and tells Jack that she has met someone else and she is leaving him. Her things are already packed. ""You will always need something to fix"", she says before she leaves. On the island, Jack discovers Locke, who is unconscious in the hatch's gun cache. Soon after, Michael enters with rifle drawn and pointed at Jack, announcing that he is going into the jungle to retrieve his son, Walt, who has been taken by the Others. Jack tries to reason with him, and volunteers to assist Michael in his task. However, Michael refuses to listen, telling Jack that he must go alone. Jack asks Michael if he would really shoot him, to which Michael replies, ""No, but I'll shoot that computer."" Michael adds that the computer is ""not what you think it is."" Jack backs down, and Michael leaves after locking Jack and Locke in the gun closet. After being freed by Kate and Sawyer, who show up to get Sawyer's bandages changed, Jack intends to go after Michael. Locke and Sawyer volunteer to accompany him, but Jack refuses Kate's request to come as well, explaining that she must stay and take care of the button. During the search for Michael, Locke reveals that he is aware of Sawyer's real name, James Ford, since Hurley had given him the passenger manifest. Locke asks Sawyer why he chose that name, but Sawyer refuses to answer. At that moment, gunshots are heard. Jack, Sawyer, and Locke continue hiking towards the source of the shots. They find shell casings from Michael's gun. That night, while Jack and Locke argue about whether to turn back or keep searching, they are met by the bearded boat captain who kidnapped Walt in ""Exodus"". The man calls them by name and apparently knows personal details about them. He tells them Walt is fine and that Michael will not find him. The man adds, ""This is not your island, this is our island, and the only reason you're living on it is because we let you live on it"", and scolds them for ""opening doors that they shouldn't be opening"". He tells them to leave their weapons and go back, and that the Others will then leave them in peace. Jack refuses, believing the man is bluffing and that there aren't that many ""Others"". The man calls out to his unseen companions, and a dozen torches suddenly ignite, surrounding Jack and his fellow castaways. The bearded man then calls for ""Alex"" to ""bring her out"". A bound-and-gagged Kate is brought forth, and the man puts a gun to her neck. It is revealed that Kate was captured as she secretly trailed Jack, Sawyer, and Locke. Faced with a difficult decision, Jack relents, and lays his weapons down. Locke and Sawyer follow. Kate is let go and Sawyer removes her gag from her mouth and unties her and the Others leave, threatening to return if the castaways ""cross the line."" Sawyer tells the bearded man that the business between them isn't over. In the bunker, Hurley and Charlie go through the LP record collection, finding one by a group named Geronimo Jackson. Hurley then asks Charlie what chances he has with Libby, though Charlie is preoccupied thinking about Claire. On the beach, Jin and Sun talk and confess to each other that neither wants to be told what to do. Upon returning to camp, Jack refuses to hear Kate's apology. Sawyer consoles her, saying he would have done the same thing if Jack had told him to stay behind. At the end of the episode, Jack speaks to Ana Lucia on the beach. He questions her about her past as a police officer and asks ""How long would it take to train an army?"". 19.13 million viewers watched the episode's first United States airing.[3] The LA Times liked the Jack flashback and ""that cool moment when the Others light their torches"", but disliked the progress of the story and the cliffhanger that went nowhere.[2]",4456,8.5
Fire + Water,2,12,Jack Bender,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Charlie,2006-01-25,19.05,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%2B_Water_(Lost),"""Fire + Water"" is the 37th episode of Lost. It is the 12th episode of the second season. The episode was directed by Jack Bender, and written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. It first aired on January 25, 2006, on ABC. The character of Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) is featured in the episode's flashbacks.[2] The episode begins with Charlie Pace, as a child, receiving a new piano. His family wants him to use his musical talent to ""save"" them and get them out of their current impoverished circumstance, but his father, dressed as a butcher, appears, saying, ""He ain't savin' no one, he is,"" and cuts the head off of a doll with a cleaver. Later, Charlie, an adult, is seen in a hospital, where Karen, his brother Liam's girlfriend, has just given birth to a daughter, named Megan after Charlie and Liam's mother. However, Liam's increasing drug habit is causing problems: it prevented him from showing up at the birth, and is interfering with the brothers' band, DriveSHAFT. When Karen throws him out, Liam turns up on his brother's doorstep, but abuses Charlie's hospitality by secretly selling his piano, defensively claiming that he needed the money in order to travel to Australia to get a job and enter rehab, ""for his family."" Hearing a baby's cries, Charlie looks towards the ocean and sees Aaron's cradle floating away. He swims out to save the baby and brings him back to the beach, where Claire and Charlie's mother, dressed as angels, repeatedly call out to Charlie that he must ""save the baby."" Hurley also appears, dressed as John the Baptist. Charlie awakens from his dream, finding that he is holding Aaron on the beach, but with no memory of how it happened. A frantic Claire runs up and takes her baby back from Charlie and slaps him across the face. When Charlie tells Eko about his dreams, Eko says that the dreams might mean that Charlie needs to save the baby, but Charlie misunderstands him. He goes to Claire to express his concerns about Aaron being in danger, meaning that they must baptize him, but Claire no longer trusts him after he repeatedly lied to her. Charlie heads to his hidden stash of heroin-filled Virgin Mary statues, but Locke follows him and confiscates them, despite Charlie's protests that he was going to destroy them himself. Locke then stores the statues in the hatch, in the same room where the guns are being secured. Later that evening, Charlie starts a fire as a diversion and steals Aaron from his crib. However, Claire notices him, and chases him to the ocean. Charlie tries to baptize him, and is reluctant to give Aaron back. He tries to convince the group that he was just trying to ""save the baby."" Eventually Locke persuades Charlie to give Aaron back, and hands him back to Claire. He then punches Charlie in the face three times, leaving him breathless and bloody. With him lying in the water, the surrounding crowd lingers for a moment and leaves without offering to help him. Despite everything that happened, at the end of the episode, Claire seeks out Eko herself. At her request, he baptizes both her and Aaron. The episode is the subject of a detailed ""Making of"" documentary on the Season 2 DVD set. All of the locations for the episode, despite appearing to be filmed in different countries, were actually modified locations in Hawaii. The producers had intended for the DriveSHAFT video to be a remake of the Beatles Abbey Road album cover, only with the bandmembers wearing diapers. However, they were unable to get permission to reproduce the scene, so instead used the diapers in a different way, singing inside of a crib while they wore the diapers. In one of the dream sequences, Charlie's mother and Claire appear as angels. This was a reproduction of the Andrea del Verrocchio painting, The Baptism of Christ. In the background of the scene (only viewable in the widescreen format), an Easter Egg was introduced, where the Nigerian drug plane, the Beechcraft containing Eko's brother, can be briefly seen en route to its crash on the island.[3] The episode garnered 19.05 million American viewers.[4] The LA Times saw this as the 109th best (or second worst) episode.[2]",4548,7.3
The Long Con,2,13,Roxann Dawson,Steven Maeda & Leonard Dick,Sawyer,2006-02-08,18.74,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Con,"""The Long Con"" is the 38th episode of Lost. It is the 13th episode of the second season. The episode was directed by Roxann Dawson, and written by Leonard Dick and Steven Maeda. It first aired on February 8, 2006, on ABC. The character of James ""Sawyer"" Ford is featured in the episode's flashbacks. In flashbacks, Sawyer attempts to con a divorced woman named Cassidy. While getting dressed, Sawyer ""accidentally"" opens a briefcase filled with fake cash bundles made from newspaper. Cassidy sees through the con immediately. She claims that she did not get a significant settlement in the proceedings, and notices that most of the money is newsprint. Cassidy is also intrigued, and asks Sawyer to teach her how to con someone. The two scheme a jewelry con by overpricing fake goods, and con two men at a gas station. They perpetrate various cons over the ensuing months. Then Cassidy asks if he can teach her how to pull off a ""long con"", and reveals that she did indeed receive a settlement of $600,000 in her divorce. Sawyer is later at a diner (his waitress is Diane, Kate's mother), having lunch with Gordy, his partner. It is revealed that Sawyer was planning to con Cassidy out of her money, but wants to back out due to his feelings for her. Gordy threatens Sawyer and Cassidy's lives if Sawyer doesn't continue with the con. In the last flashback, Sawyer returns to the house and tells Cassidy to run because Sawyer's partner Gordy is going to kill them, and points to a car outside. He reveals that the ""long con"" is Cassidy herself, and that he knew about her money from the beginning, but Gordy is going to kill them because Sawyer doesn't want to steal Cassidy's money. He sends her off with the money, packed in a bag. He goes to the car, which turns out to be empty. He then returns to the house and retrieves the real money, which he had concealed while he tricked Cassidy. Jack and Locke secure all the weapons, medicine, and Virgin Mary statues in the storeroom. Jack puts the six guns in the U.S. Marshal's suitcase, along with the key, in the gun cache. The two agree that no one else should be privy to the combination, and that each one will not gain access without the other being present. Sawyer remarks that he and Charlie are now the two most hated people on the island. Charlie replies by telling Sawyer he ought to be more concerned about Jack ransacking his tent. Sawyer confronts Jack, who explains that he is simply returning the pain killers which Sawyer stole. Sawyer replies that the pain killers were actually stolen from his ""stash"" while he was on the raft. Sawyer also points out to Kate that Jack is now confiding in Ana Lucía rather than her. Ana Lucía asks Jack if Locke gave him the combination for the guns, and he responds that he did. Ana feels that the survivors ""aren't scared enough"" and that they all feel they are safe. Ana then asks Jack for the combination, but when Jack hesitates, Ana tells him she was just kidding. While Kate is reading to Sawyer, he mentions the army that Jack and Ana Lucía are forming. Meanwhile, in an attempt to assuage Sayid's grief over the death of Shannon, Hurley attempts to connect with Sayid. Hurley tells Sayid that he went to Rose and Bernard's tent, and got their radio from the Arrow Hatch. Hurley also has discovered that Bernard was the one who picked up Boone's transmission from the Nigerian Drug Plane. He asks Sayid if he can boost the power somehow to help them send another signal, but Sayid says that it would not work. Sun is working in her garden when she hears a noise coming from the foliage. Her fears are alleviated when Vincent runs into the garden. Just after Vincent leaves, a burlap bag is put over her head, her hands are tied together tightly and she is dragged away. Sawyer and Kate hear her screams. They run to her and find her unconscious. They bring her back to camp, and the castaways fear the Others are back. Jack determines that Sun will be fine. Jin demands a gun to seek revenge. Despite Jack's wishes to wait for Sun to regain consciousness before an investigation, Sawyer and Kate return to the site of Sun's attack for an inspection. They find the burlap bag, which is a different make from the bag used by ""Mr. Friendly"" on Kate. They deduce that one of the survivors may have attempted the kidnapping. Kate suspects Ana Lucía, who she thinks wants to instill fear in the survivors so they will form an army against the Others. Kate expresses her concerns to Jack, and asks Sawyer to alert Locke that Jack is coming for the guns. Locke decides to move the guns so Jack and Jin can't get at them. Locke leaves Sawyer to ""push the button"" while he hides the entire arsenal. Jack enters the hatch in search of a gun, but finds the safe empty. Sawyer taunts him and tosses him the pain killers which Jack took from his tent. When Jack confronts Locke on the beach about the missing weaponry, Locke defends his actions by pointing out that Jack was about to break their agreement. During this heated discussion, shots ring out and Sawyer appears, wielding an automatic rifle. Sawyer reveals that the incident was an elaborate ""long con"" to seize the guns and declare himself the ""new sheriff in town"". Unknown to the rest, the attacker in the garden (as well as the one who tracked Locke to the hiding place) was Charlie, who agreed to take part in the plot in order to humiliate Locke. Sawyer offers him one of the Virgin Mary statues, but he refuses it. Charlie asks Sawyer how anyone could think of such an ingenious plot, Sawyer remembers his long con of Cassidy for a moment, then replies, ""I'm not a good person, Charlie. I never did a good thing in my life."" Sayid brings Hurley the radio, along with a transmission amplifier to boost the signal. They first pick up the sound of a female French voice speaking, which Sayid assumes is Rousseau's distress transmission, and then they pick up a radio transmission of Glenn Miller's ""Moonlight Serenade"". Though Hurley initially assumes that they must be close to the transmission source, Sayid explains that, due to radio waves bouncing off the ionosphere, shortwave radio signals can potentially travel thousands of miles. Sayid says it could be coming from any place, to which Hurley replies ""...or any time"", adding later that he was joking.",4659,8.7

The episode was directed by Stephen Williams, and written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. It first aired on February 15, 2006, on ABC. The character of Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. In the episode, the survivors meet and interrogate Henry Gale (Michael Emerson), a man whom they believe to be an ""Other"". In a flashback, the 1991 Allied invasion of Iraq is under way. Sayid, an Iraqi soldier, is seen burning documents with fellow soldiers. Some are resisting, and as Sayid's commander orders them to continue, American troops burst in. Sayid tries to lie, saying that their commanding officer , Tariq, has abandoned them, but the American soldier, Sam Austen (Lindsey Ginter) (who is also Kate's step-father[2]) doesn't believe him. Sayid is held captive by the Americans, who have found Tariq. Two higher-ranked military men ask Sayid to act as a translator, and Sayid attempts to get his CO to reveal the location of a captive American pilot. Speaking in their own language, which the Americans cannot understand, Sayid's CO orders him to grab the American's gun and kill as many as he can, but Sayid refuses. Austen knows they can't get the information and call in the next man; an American DIA agent named Kelvin Inman (Clancy Brown) orders Sayid to torture the Iraqi officer; at first, Sayid refuses this too, but agrees after the agent shows him a video of Sayid's family being gassed on the officer's orders. But while interrogating the officer, Sayid learns that it's too late, and that the pilot had been executed anyway. Sayid is eventually released by the Americans, who are pulling out. In the truck, Austen asks Sayid if he has have a wife or kids?"" to which he shakes Austen asked him looks down at a photo which shows a young-looking Kate. Inman tells him that the day will come when Sayid needs information from someone — and that he will have the means to get it. He appears to speak fluent Arabic, much to Sayid's shock. However, Sayid vows never to torture again. Just before he leaves, Inman gives him several hundred American dollars for a ""bus ride back to Ramadi"". On the island, Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) takes Sayid into the jungle, and he tells her to go back after seeing Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), who tells him she was looking for him. Danielle asks Sayid to follow her, but he doesn't trust her, since the last time they met she set up a diversion and stole Claire's baby. She gives him her gun as a symbol of trust. Danielle takes Sayid to a man she captured, who is in a net hanging from a tree. Danielle tells Sayid not to let him go, because she thinks he is ""one of them"". The man identifies himself as Henry Gale from Minnesota. Ignoring Danielle's warning, Sayid frees the man, who attempts to flee until Danielle shoots him in the back with a crossbow. When Sayid points out she almost killed him, she replies that if she wanted to kill him, she would have done so already. Sayid brings Henry Gale to the hatch and tells John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) that he needs to talk to Henry. Henry claims he and his wife were in a hot air balloon that crashed on the island about four months ago. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) interrupts and notices Henry's injury. Sayid explains that it wasn't treated because they want to learn as much as they can about the man while he is still wounded. Jack intervenes and removes the arrow but Sayid tells Jack not to untie Henry. Sayid asks Locke to change the combination in the armory, so he can find out more by torturing Henry in a secure room. Sayid tells Jack to put him in the armory so no one else will see him. There, Sayid enters with Henry, and closes the door behind him. Sayid interrogates Henry, who says that he and his wife, Jennifer, were in a hot air balloon crossing the Pacific Ocean when they crashed four or more months ago on the north shore. He said he was rich because he owned a company that mined for non-metallic minerals. Sayid picks up on this and questions his use of the past tense. Henry admits he's taken to thinking of his life in the outside world as something in the past. He continues, saying he met his wife at the University of Minnesota. After they crashed on the island, Henry claims that his wife got sick three weeks earlier, starting with a fever, degrading to delirium and ultimately resulting in her death. He describes his hot air balloon and says he dug his wife's grave near where they crashed. Sayid then moves forward and grabs one of Henry's fingers, holding it with the pliers. He then starts questioning more ferociously, threatening to break Henry's finger. Meanwhile, James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) is unable to sleep due to a chirping noise coming from the jungle. He asks Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) to help him find the source of the noise, but Jin ignores him, so Sawyer goes into the jungle on his own, and while searching, discovers Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) eating from a hidden stash of food from the hatch. Hurley tells Sawyer that the noise is coming from a tree frog. Sawyer blackmails Hurley, saying he won't tell anyone else that Hurley has a secret stash of food, if Hurley helps him track the tree frog. As they search though, Sawyer makes rude remarks about Hurley's weight, and Hurley decides to go back and leave Sawyer alone to search for the frog, saying that though he (Hurley) stole food, people still like him, unlike Sawyer. Sawyer then apologizes and convinces Hurley to carry on. Sawyer and Hurley find the frog. Hurley offers to release it two beaches away, but Sawyer suddenly kills the frog by crushing it in his hand. In response to Sayid's questioning, Henry is unable to recount the specific details of burying his wife. Sayid believes he is lying about his identity, stating he would know every last detail about digging his wife's grave. Henry then realizes that Sayid had lost someone close to him on the island. Sayid beats Henry as Jack and Locke listen from outside. Jack takes action by holding Locke, preventing him from entering the numbers at the appointed time, telling him he will only let Locke go if he opens the door. The timer goes below a minute and Locke complies by unlocking the armory and then dashing for the computer. By the time he unlocks the door, there were only ten seconds. He begins typing the code. However, in his haste he mistypes and has to correct it. As the timer passes zero, the black and white numbers flip over to red symbols. Two are Egyptian hieroglyphs, two are unknown characters and the second square from the left doesn't stop turning before the camera cuts back to Locke. The Symbols are accompanied with the loud sound of a machine ""spooling up"" like a jet engine turbine. Locke finally hits the 'Execute' button, at which point the timer resets to 108 and the sound dies down. Meanwhile, in the armory, Jack bursts in and stops an enraged Sayid, who yells, ""He's lying!"" several times. They lock a bloodied Henry back in the armory. Henry has a sinister, ""knowing"" look in his eyes. Jack recalls to Sayid how Danielle tortured him because she thought Sayid was an ""other"". Locke arrives, and agrees with Jack, stating, ""To Rousseau, we're all 'others'."" Sayid is then back on the beach talking to Charlie about what happened in the hatch. Sayid thinks Henry is an ""Other"" because he feels no guilt about torturing him. He states that Jack and Locke will never understand that feeling, because they have forgotten what the Others have done to them. He asks Charlie if he remembers how the Others hanged him from the tree and kidnapped Claire. He says that the Others are merciless. Then he simply asks Charlie if he's forgotten what the Others have done to him. In 2001, American actor Michael Emerson won an Emmy award for his guest appearance as serial killer William Hinks on The Practice.[3] The Lost producers liked his work on The Practice, so they were keen to cast Emerson in the role of ""Henry Gale"", as they thought he would fit the character well.[4] Emerson was originally contracted to appear in just three episodes of Lost,[5] making his first appearance midway through the second season, in this episode. The producers later contracted him for another five episodes, and he would later be made a part of the main cast in the third season.[6] 18.20 million viewers watched this episode.[7]",4488,8.7
Maternity Leave,2,15,Jack Bender,Dawn Lambertsen Kelly & Matt Ragghianti,Claire,2006-03-01,16.43,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity_Leave_(Lost),"""Maternity Leave"" is the 15th episode of the second season of the American drama television series Lost, and the 40th episode overall. The episode was directed by Jack Bender, and written by Dawn Lambertsen Kelly and Matt Ragghianti. It first aired on ABC in the United States on March 1, 2006. The character of Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) is featured in the episode's flashbacks, revealing what happened when she was kidnapped by Ethan, an Other. ""Maternity Leave"" was seen by an estimated 16.43 million American household viewers. It received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, with praise for the mysteries further revealed in the episode, while its rote plot development was criticized. Aaron has become ill with a rash and fever, and Claire sets off in the night to find Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) intercedes and goes instead of her. While Locke is gone, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) appears and tells Claire that Aaron is ""infected."" Claire has a flashback where she remembers being injected with a needle while pregnant. Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) sends Rousseau away, though Claire is now convinced that something is seriously wrong with Aaron. Jack assures Claire that Aaron is fine and the fever will soon break, but Claire is unsure. She speaks to Libby (Cynthia Watros), who helps her recall memories from the two weeks when she was abducted by an Other named Ethan (William Mapother). Claire remembers what resembles a doctor's office and Ethan giving her injections. She was confused (apparently drugged) during this entire ordeal, and believed that she was still in Australia and about to leave for the United States. Claire enlists Kate to help her find Rousseau, and to find a vaccine she remembered from her memories, believing that it is the cure for Aaron's ailment. Claire asks Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) to take care of Aaron while she is away. Sun tells her that a mother should never leave her child. Claire asks Sun if she is a mother. Sun replies ""no"", but agrees to watch the baby. The conversation with Sun again triggers a memory of Claire's which Ethan gave her injections before leading her to a baby room, to her surprise. During the escort, Claire observed a lair with a slope and stairs going to a metal wall, as well as a modified Dharma Initiative logo unlike the one in The Swan. She also remembers Ethan talking to an other (M.C. Gainey). The other tells Ethan he is unhappy that Claire was brought to the facility, as ""the list"" had not been prepared. He also mentions that a higher authority will not be pleased. Ethan tells the other that the survivors had a passenger manifest and knew that he (Ethan) was not on the plane. Claire and Kate soon find Rousseau, who is puzzled by an increasingly irrational Claire. However, Rousseau takes them back to the place where she said she found Claire the night Claire returned to camp after her abduction. There, Claire wants Rousseau to take her to the room with the vaccine and grows accusatory of Rousseau aiding her abduction when Rousseau tells her she doesn't know where the room is. Claire suddenly notices a stump in the jungle that triggers another memory; she remembers Ethan Rom talking to her about leaving the baby with his group when they had a walk out of the facility. Ethan tells Claire that she does have a choice in the matter. Ethan gives Claire some water from a canteen, and she complains of the sour taste. Ethan tells Claire that her baby is one of the ""good ones."" Investigating further, the three women find a concealed bunker with the DHARMA logo on it. Unlike the swan symbol in the DHARMA logo on the Facility 3 bunker, the symbol on this bunker is a caduceus. Inside, all but one of the lights are out and the bunker appears to be abandoned. Claire finds rooms familiar to her memories, she finds a bootie she crocheted during the last time she was there and puts it in her pack, while Kate investigates another part of the bunker. She discovers a set of lockers. Upon opening one, she discovers tattered clothes, a box containing makeup, theatrical glue, and a beard — all parts of the disguise worn by the other in her previous encounter with him. Claire locates the refrigerator where she remembered the vaccine being stored; it is now empty. She has a flashback of a young teenaged girl (Tania Raymonde) who rescues her from the bunker, telling Claire that the other members of her group plan to take the baby and kill Claire. Rousseau then leaves, telling Claire that she is ""not the only one who didn't find what they were looking for."" Back in the jungle, Claire has one final flashback where she remembers that Rousseau aided her escape, and was not part of the group that kidnapped her. She asks Rousseau about the baby that the Others took from her sixteen years ago. Claire asks if the child was a girl and Rousseau replies, ""Yes, a girl, Alex. Alexandra."" Claire then tells Rousseau that a teenaged girl with blue eyes helped her escape. Claire says, ""She wasn't like the others. She was good."" Rousseau, on the verge of tears, then warns Claire that if Aaron is infected, she knows what she'll have to do. Claire and Kate return to camp, where Jack tells her Aaron's fever has subsided. Claire then takes out the bootie that she found in the bunker and gives it to Aaron. Meanwhile, Jack and Locke are trying to decide what to do about their new prisoner, Henry Gale (Michael Emerson). Locke gives Henry a copy of the Fyodor Dostoyevsky novel The Brothers Karamazov. A minute later, Locke tells Jack that Ernest Hemingway wanted to be the greatest writer in the world, but felt that he could never escape being in the shadow of Dostoyevsky. Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) visits the bunker during this time and figures out what is going on. He asks Jack to let him visit with the prisoner, alone, and Jack agrees after Eko subtly threatens that he will tell the rest of the camp about the prisoner. Eko tells Henry about the two men he killed when they tried to abduct him from his camp. Henry asks why Eko is telling him, and Eko replies that he had to tell someone. Eko threateningly takes out his knife, cuts two knots out of his beard, and leaves. Locke brings dinner to Henry, who strikes up a conversation about Hemingway and Dostoyevsky. Henry had heard the earlier talk about the authors through the thin walls. Henry asks Locke which of the authors he relates to more, but Locke does not have an answer. He then asks Locke why he lets Jack call the shots, but Locke insists that he and Jack make decisions together. Locke locks up Henry and returns to the bunker's kitchen, where he loses his temper and violently sweeps the dishes off the counter (which could be heard by Henry). Tania Raymonde was told her character would be called ""Jessica"" when first cast in the role, and her character was promoted as a survivor who would be introduced in ""Maternity Leave'. Cast members often read fake lines with a different name in their audition to limit potential spoilers from leaking.[2] In her first appearance, Raymonde was credited as ""young girl"", preventing viewers knowing in advance that Alex would be introduced. 16.43 million American viewers watched ""Maternity Leave"" live.[3] Writing in 2008 for IGN, Chris Carabott gave the episode a grade of 7.5 out of 10 and commended the further revelations about the Others, though he pointed out that it is still slight enough that casual viewers could understandably be frustrated.[4]Alan Sepinwall considered ""Maternity Leave"" a notable improvement over the previous episode, ""One of Them"", stating that the former had ""[m]ystery revelations that were actually useful"".[5] Daniel MacEachern of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+.[6] However, in another IGN article in 2014, Eric Goldman ranked ""Maternity Leave"" as 95th out of all the episodes of Lost, emphasizing the routine quality of the plot with the onomatopoeic ""Zzzzzz"", which indicates snoring.[7]",4478,8.4
The Whole Truth,2,16,Karen Gaviola,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Christina M. Kim,Sun,2006-03-22,15.3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Whole_Truth_(Lost),"""The Whole Truth"" is the 41st episode of Lost. It is the 16th episode of the second season. The episode was directed by Karen Gaviola, and written by Elizabeth Sarnoff and Christina M. Kim. It first aired on March 22, 2006, on ABC. The character of Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim) is featured in the episode's flashbacks, which revolve around her and Jin Kwon's (Daniel Dae Kim) fertility problems. In their apartment, Sun and Jin are about to make love, when Jin asks Sun if she took her temperature, ruining the mood. He says they've been trying for a year to conceive, and he thinks she should see a fertility doctor. Sun asks why he wants a baby he will never see. Jin says he's sorry for the things Sun's father makes him do and that a baby would change everything. The fertility doctor, however, advises them that Sun cannot conceive due to advanced endometriosis. Sun enters a hotel room to meet Jae Lee, her suitor from before she met Jin. Their conversation indicates the two are regularly meeting to teach English and seek advice on Sun's relationship. She tells Jae that she was glad to learn about her infertility. Jae asks her why she's learning English, to which Sun replies that she's leaving Jin for America. Jae tells Sun that one can't run away from their life. Sun asks if Jin is her life and Jae says he's not saying she should stay for Jin. Sun is walking her dog when the fertility doctor drives by and confesses to Sun that it's actually Jin who can't have children. He tells her he lied because if Jin found out it was he who could not have children, Jin would burn down his practice. An angry Jin tries to take Sun away from her garden and back to the beach, given her previous abduction from the garden. They have an argument and Jin pulls out all of the plants. She runs to the beach and, in pain, meets Bernard and Rose, who are having an argument of their own. She later asks Sawyer for a pregnancy test, which turns out to be manufactured by Widmore labs. Locke convinces Ana Lucia that given her police training and encounters with the Others, she should interrogate Henry Gale. He repeats the balloon story and draws a map to the balloon, where he had buried his wife. Ana Lucia promises that she'll keep him alive if the map confirms his story. Together with Sayid and Charlie (whom Sayid have told previously about the prisoner in the hatch's armory), she goes in search for the balloon. Ana Lucia realizes from Charlie's gait that he's carrying a concealed gun, and asks him to give it to someone who knows how to use it. Charlie replies with “the last time you had a gun you murdered someone” and gives the gun to Sayid. As Sun is waiting for her pregnancy test results to show up, she asks Kate if she has ever taken a test, which she replies that she has. Sun thanks Kate for being there and not asking questions. When the test turns up positive, she does not seem too thrilled. She asks if it is accurate and they go to Jack to find out. He says those tests are very accurate, and that the two pink lines means she is definitely pregnant. Sun asks Jack to not tell anybody. Ana Lucia joins Sayid by a campfire. She says people dislike her and she has been trying most of her life to get them to like her. She says she gave up a while back and that she is who she is. She tells Sayid he has a good reason to hate her. She apologizes for what she did. Sayid says it wasn’t her fault, and explains that he holds the Others responsible for Shannon's death (as they are the ones who indirectly caused Ana to shoot Shannon); he comments that once they find out if Henry is one of them, something will have to be done. It’s morning and Sayid waits for Ana Lucia to wake up. Charlie brings papayas for them to eat but Sayid really wants to leave. They find where the balloon should be but it is not there. Ana Lucia insists that they should look some more around the area. Sayid divides the area into three parts and tells Ana Lucia to search as thoroughly as she pleases. Bernard is searching for an oyster for his wife and Jin tells him (in English) ""no oyster here"". Sawyer comes up and tells Bernard that Sun is pregnant. They start talking about it, but Jin can't understand them. Jin goes and replants the plants he pulled out. He tells Sun he hates fighting like they do and that he hates not being able to understand everyone. He apologizes and Sun tells him she’s pregnant. He’s overjoyed and Sun tells him she needs to tell him something. Sun tells Jin he is the one who cannot have children, not her. He asks Sun how she can be pregnant and she promises she did not cheat. He then helps Sun rebuild her garden. Sun asks if she can stay and work in her garden as Jin wants to return to the beach. Jin bends down and kisses Sun. He tells her he loves her in English. Jack asks Henry how the book is and takes him out of the prison he has been locked in. Henry asks him what the computer is for and Jack says it is for nothing. Henry eats some cereal. He says he figures it’s his reward for drawing the map. Locke and Jack are caught off guard since they didn’t know about the map. Henry then ""hypothetically"" thinks out loud that if he in fact were one of the Others, he would probably lead them into a trap so when Ana Lucia, Sayid, and Charlie get to where the map leads them, the Others would take them hostage and trade them for him. He then mentions that it's a good thing he's not one of them as he nonchalantly asks if they have any milk for his cereal. Michael Emerson, who portrays Henry Gale, was originally contracted to appear in just three episodes of Lost,[2] making his first appearance in ""One of Them"". The producers were so impressed by him that they contracted him for a further five episodes, citing the scene at the end of this episode where Henry asks for milk as the moment they knew he was a ""keeper"".[3] He was then made a part of the regular cast from the third season.[4] 15.30 million American viewers viewed this episode.[5]",4302,8.2
Lockdown,2,17,Stephen Williams,Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof,Locke,2006-03-29,16.21,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown_(Lost),"""Lockdown"" is the 17th episode of the second season of the American drama television series Lost, and the 42nd episode overall. The episode was directed by Stephen Williams, and written by executive producers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof. It first aired on ABC in the United States on March 29, 2006. The character of John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is featured in the episode's flashbacks, revealing how he broke up with his romantic partner Helen (Katey Sagal). In the present, the Dharma Initiative station that Locke is in suddenly and inexplicably places itself under lockdown, leaving him and his captive Henry Gale (Michael Emerson) to find a way out and input the numbers before the station's countdown ends. Meanwhile, Jack (Matthew Fox) plays a card game with Sawyer (Josh Holloway) before a large package of food is discovered to have mysteriously dropped on the island. ""Lockdown"" was seen by an estimated 16.21 million American household viewers. The episode received positive reviews from critics, with praise given for the plot development and Emerson's performance. Locke is preparing to propose to his girlfriend, Helen, at a picnic, but while he is preparing the lunch, she notices Locke's father's (Kevin Tighe) name in the obituaries, so they postpone the picnic to attend the funeral. No one else is there, except two mysterious men standing in the distance. There is also a silver Mercedes with a driver who continuously glares at Locke throughout the funeral far away. At the conclusion of the service, Locke stands next to the coffin and says, ""I forgive you."" Later, it is revealed that he has opened his own business inspecting homes. After checking the home of Nadia, he sees the same silver car near his house, and finds that it is his father driving it, who had faked his own death to escape from the two men who are trying to kill him because of a ""retirement con"". He wants Locke to go to the bank to get the money for him from a safety deposit box, and keep $200,000 as payment. After going to the safety deposit box and collecting the money, Locke returns home and encounters the two mysterious men who question him about the validity of his father's death and search his work bag. When Helen asks Locke about the situation, he lies to her and says that he has not seen his father. When Locke meets up with his father at the motel, he tells his father that he is planning on marrying Helen. But when he leaves, he sees Helen has followed him, and she is hurt by his lies. She breaks up with Locke, accusing him of choosing his father's love over hers. Locke gets down on one knee and proposes, but Helen shakes her head and drives away, leaving Locke to stare at his father getting into a taxi cab to leave as well. Henry Gale tries to convince Locke and a suspicious Jack that he was making a bad joke about leading Sayid's (Naveen Andrews) group into a trap. After Jack and Locke argue about what to do next, Jack storms off, leaving Locke to put Henry back in the armory. When Jack reaches the beach, he sees Kate (Evangeline Lilly), Hurley (Jorge Garcia), and Sawyer playing poker with some DHARMA Initiative playing cards. After showing that he knows a lot about how to play, he challenges Sawyer to a game to win back the medicine that Sawyer has been hoarding. Jack wins the game and says he'll collect the medicine later. In the hatch, while Locke is pedaling on the stationary bike, he suddenly hears static noise coming from the speakers throughout the hatch, even though there are still 47 minutes left on the timer. A few seconds later, a female voice counts down from ten, and the blast doors quickly begin to shut when she reaches zero, but Locke wedges one open with a crowbar. He then enlists Henry Gale's help to further open the doors, forcing one up a couple of feet and then sliding a toolbox underneath to prop it open. Locke tries to slide through the gap, but the door crushes the toolbox and his legs. One of the metal poles on the underside of the door impales his leg, trapping him under the door. Since the timer is still counting down, Locke tells Henry how to get into the computer room through the vents to input the numbers, and Henry agrees to the mission on the condition that Locke will protect him from the other survivors. While Gale is gone, the timer begins to beep rapidly, signaling the beginning of the one-minute countdown, then the alarm stops, there is a whirring noise (similar to the jet engine-like sound in ""One of Them"") and the lights go out. Seconds later, blacklights come on and for exactly thirty seconds a diagram is revealed on the blast door that Locke is trapped under. It appears to be a multi-layered map of the island, but it is only shown briefly before the ordinary lights turn back on and the blast doors retract to their normal positions. Henry steps out of the computer room and tells Locke that he did what Locke asked him to do. On the beach, Kate sees a flashing light in the jungle, and when she and Jack investigate, they find an enormous package of food attached to a parachute. They are quickly joined by Sayid, Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), and Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), who have returned from their expedition. When Jack enters the hatch, he grabs Henry off of the injured Locke, though Locke tries to defend Henry, saying that he was helping him after the blast doors came down. Sayid confirms that they found the balloon and the grave and they were exactly where Henry had said they were. However, Sayid adds that he was still skeptical as to the validity of Henry's story, so he dug up the grave to verify it was his wife's, and found a man's body instead, which held the photo ID of a black man named Henry Gale. This confirms the survivors' suspicion that ""Henry"" is not who he says he is. ""Lockdown"" first aired in the United States on March 29, 2006. An estimated 16.21 million viewers watched the episode.[2] Writing in 2009 for IGN, Chris Carabott gave the episode 8.7 out of 10, praising how the episode's events set up the remaining episodes of season two as well as singling out Michael Emerson's ""brilliant"" performance as Henry Gale.[3] In another IGN article in 2014, Eric Goldman ranked ""Lockdown"" as 46th out of all the episodes of Lost, mainly commending the twist involving Gale's identity.[4]",4966,9.1
Dave,2,18,Jack Bender,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Hurley,2006-04-05,16.38,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_(Lost),"""Dave"" is the 43rd episode of Lost and the 18th episode of the second season. The episode was directed by Jack Bender, and written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. It first aired on April 5, 2006, on ABC. In flashbacks, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes is in a mental institution, where he deals with an imaginary friend, Dave. Libby also has a brief flashback in this episode, revealing that she attended the institution along with Hurley. The island events in the present day have Hurley seeing Dave on the island, while other survivors confront ""Henry Gale"" (Michael Emerson) after his stated backstory is revealed to be false. The episode addresses a fan theory which considered the events of the series to be hallucinations or dreams. The character of Dave was written as both a side of Hurley who denied his problems and an analogue to Hurley's disappeared father, and his scenes were filmed so that his reveal as imaginary would be a plot twist. Hurley (Jorge Garcia) is in a mental institution, where he is friends with Dave (Evan Handler), who tells Hurley to ignore the doctors, avoid his medication, and try to escape. One day, Hurley's doctor, Dr. Brooks (Bruce Davison), proves to Hurley that Dave is not real, by taking a photo of the two, and then showing Hurley that Dave is not in the picture. Later that night, Dave wakes Hurley up to escape with him from the institute, suggesting that the photo was doctored. Dave hops out of a window, but Hurley confronts him and declares that Dave is not real, and shuts the window on him before going back to bed. A later flashback reveals that during the moment Dr. Brooks took the picture of Hurley and Dave, another patient was staring at Hurley from across the room, Libby (Cynthia Watros), which explains why Hurley has had this faint recognition of Libby while on the island. Hurley confesses to Libby that he has an eating disorder, and shows her a stash of Dharma food. Hurley expresses interest in getting rid of it, and she encourages him to do so. Just after Hurley destroys his supplies, other survivors go into the jungle. Following them, Hurley and Libby see that an enormous package of food parachuted from the sky. After Hurley panics at the suggestion of again being in charge of the supplies, he sees Dave, and tries to follow him as he goes into the jungle. After Hurley loses Dave's trail twice, he asks Sawyer (Josh Holloway) for medicine to fight the hallucinations he believes he's been having. After mocking Hurley, Sawyer is brutally attacked by him and his tent ruined. Hurley decides to leave the beach and go to the caves. On the way, Dave reappears, and tells Hurley that everything that has happened since the night of the escape attempt has been a fantasy — that after Dave escaped, Hurley went into a catatonic state and has imagined everything since then. As proof, Dave points out the appearances of the numbers said by another intern, Leonard (Ron Bottitta) in both Hurley's winning lottery ticket and the hatch computer number-sequence. Dave takes Hurley to a cliff, and tells him to jump and get out of his dream, before jumping off himself. Before Hurley can decide whether or not to follow Dave, Libby finds him. Hurley states to her he believes everything happening is not real, and is only a comatose dream, including her, but Libby convinces him otherwise, in part by kissing him. In the hatch, Sayid (Naveen Andrews) and Ana-Lucía (Michelle Rodriguez) interrogate ""Henry Gale"" (Michael Emerson). After Henry's new cover-up story is proved false, Henry finally admits that he is indeed an Other, but says he would be killed if he talks. Later, Locke (Terry O'Quinn) confronts the prisoner, demanding to know if he let himself be caught, thinking it might have been to find the Swan. ""Henry"", however, calls the hatch a ""joke"", saying that during the lockdown, he never entered the numbers into the computer or pushed the button; he simply stood there, and watched the timer's numbers turn to red hieroglyphs before they reset back on their own. Locke, however, replies that Henry is lying, but he replies that he's ""done lying"". ABC was concerned about the content of the episode, arguing that the idea that the story could be all in Hurley's head was offering an explanation for the show as a whole,[2] since a recurring theory among the fandom was that the events of the series were hallucinations.[3] The character of Dave was meant to be a side of Hurley who felt he had no problem, and encourages Hurley to overeat, and is played by Evan Handler in a way director Jack Bender described as ""mischievous, impish-like"".[3] Showrunner Carlton Cuse revealed his name comes from Hurley's father, David Reyes - who would later appear in the series played by Cheech Marin - because the writers ""wanted Hurley to imagine a friend and have that be wrapped up in his unresolved relationship with his dad"".[4] The final scene with Libby was so secret that only Jack Bender and his assistant director had it in their scripts, and to prevent Libby from being the only woman in the mental institution, every woman on the set, including Bender's daughter Sophie, was dressed in robes and pajamas to appear as background characters.[3] Director Bender decided to depict Dave in a way audiences would first believe him to be real, but without the character actually interacting with the physical world, similar to films such as The Sixth Sense and A Beautiful Mind.[3] For the scene in which Dave walks through the jungle with Hurley, red and orange flowers were placed to add some ""magic"" to the scene, something Bender described as a ""'Hurley in Wonderland' feel"".[3] The scene in which Hurley attacks Sawyer was intended to be a humorous moment, with Bender suggesting that the tent be knocked over, and Josh Holloway adding Sawyer trying to escape but being pulled back.[5] The scene in which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events are occurring in his mind suffered from continuous interruption, as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises. Weather problems also plagued production, with loud waves causing Hurley's and Libby's beach scene to be redubbed in post-production, and rain on one day changing the location of the basketball game scene to an indoor court, and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff. The cliff was digitally redesigned in post-production to appear as if the actors were standing on the edge.[3] Dave's jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen,[5] with the body hitting the water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics.[3] The mental hospital was shot at the Laniakea YWCA in Honolulu,[5] except for Dr. Brooks's office, which was done inside a studio.[3] 16.38 million American viewers tuned into this episode.[6] Reviews were mixed. Scott Brown of Entertainment Weekly praised Jorge Garcia's and Michael Emerson's performances, and said that the episode made the island ""feel dangerous again"".[7] Ryan J. Budke of TV Squad felt that the B-story in the hatch was more interesting than Hurley's scenes, and considered ""Dave"" depressing, in opposition to the other ""so light-hearted"" Hurley-centered episodes.[8]IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7 out of 10, considering it entertaining even if it ""doesn't really impact the series as a whole,""[9] but the website later ranked ""Dave"" as the 9th worst Lost episode ever, describing it as meaningless and saying the flashback ""felt pretty extraneous.""[10]New York magazine listed ""Dave"" sixth in a ""Twenty Most Pointless Episodes of Lost"" list, considering that ""using an episode to disprove a theory that wasn’t so prevalent was a waste of time.""[11] On the other hand, the Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the 30th best of the series, describing it as ""perhaps the most misunderstood episode of Lost ever,"" saying that Dave not being real was meant to be a twist, but just ""the biggest expression of just how messed up Hurley was before he found the island.""[12]",4644,8.3
S.O.S.,2,19,Eric Laneuville,Steven Maeda & Leonard Dick,Rose & Bernard,2006-04-12,15.68,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.O.S._(Lost),"""S.O.S."" is the 19th episode of the second season of Lost and the 44th episode overall. The episode was directed by Eric Laneuville, and written by Steven Maeda and Leonard Dick. It first aired on April 12, 2006, on ABC. The characters of Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell) and Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) are featured in the episode's flashbacks. Bernard and Rose are seen meeting for the first time when he helps get her car unstuck from the snow. Rose, initially reluctant to accept his help, ultimately manages to free the car with his support. In return for his assistance, and perhaps a result of an initial attraction, she offers to buy him a cup of coffee. Bernard and Rose are lunching with a view of Niagara Falls, five months after their first meeting. At this point, Bernard proposes to Rose, citing that they ""fell into this rhythm"". Rose, without giving an answer, reveals she is terminally ill with cancer, and has a year left to live, perhaps slightly longer. Bernard nevertheless reaffirms his proposal, to which Rose responds with an affirmative. On their honeymoon, Bernard takes her to Australia to see a faith healer, Isaac of Uluru. Rose becomes angry and says, ""I have made my peace with what's happening to me."" However, Bernard succeeds in persuading Rose to talk to Isaac, who states that his office is on top of a place of great energy, perhaps magnetic or geological. He says he will attempt to harness that energy to give it to others. However, he says he is unable to help Rose because the energy in Australia is not the right kind for her. He even offers to return Bernard's money, but Rose tells him to keep it, saying that she will tell Bernard that Isaac ""fixed"" her so that Bernard would stop trying to save her life. In the airport, Rose drops her pills while waiting for a boarding call. Locke, still in his wheelchair, returns them to her. Rose Henderson and Bernard Nadler are bickering over the recent arrival of DHARMA Initiative food drops. Bernard posits that the other survivors had already ""given up"" on being rescued. Jack approaches James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) to explain his plan for a prisoner exchange. Jack invites Kate to accompany him into the jungle, and she agrees to come. Bernard enlists Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) to gather the survivors for an impromptu meeting. Bernard admonishes the others for losing their will to be rescued. He, citing the supply plane that must have dropped the DHARMA rations, suggests to create a SOS sign. Rose shoots down the plan, dismissing it as giving the others ""false hope"". Bernard asks Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) and Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) to help build his S.O.S. sign, but the two men respond they are too busy building a church. Bernard, incredulous at the seemingly cavalier attitude the survivors have towards their rescue, storms off. Later, Bernard tells a diminished group a newfangled plan to bring rocks from a field for the S.O.S. Hurley and Jin express skepticism for Bernard's planning skills. Bernard encounters more apathy when he tries to enlist Sawyer's help, and reveals to Rose his group had diminished to four. Bernard and Rose argue, as Rose suggests his managing skills aren't up to par. Later, Bernard and Jin engage in an argument over the placement of the rocks. Jin is visibly fatigued from the labor, and walks away. Bernard calls out, telling him he wants to get Rose home, but Jin simply apologizes and walks away. Rose derides Bernard's plan to Locke, but Locke is more sympathetic. Locke tells her that he's ""done with the hatch"", but Rose is skeptical. Locke tells her that Jack diagnosed a four-week period of healing, but Rose says ""you and I both know it's not going to take that long"". This is in reference to the airport flashback, revealing that Rose knows Locke was in a wheelchair before the plane crash. Bernard continues to work on the S.O.S. alone. Rose brings him some supper and offers him an apology for lying about being healed by Isaac. Rose says that she was nevertheless healed because after the crash, she ""couldn't feel"" the illness inside of her anymore. She tells him that the island healed her, and tells him with absolute certainty that she knows who or what healed her. Bernard realizes that Rose doesn't want to be rescued from fear of regaining the illness away from the island. Upon his revelation, he tells Rose that he won't leave the island or try to continue the sign. Meanwhile, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) attempts to remember and to draw the writing he saw on the blast doors in ""Lockdown"", but to no avail. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) enters the armory to change Henry Gale's (Michael Emerson) bandages and to interrogate him. Jack tells Henry that he plans to cross the line of the Others and tell them that Henry is a captive. Jack suggests Henry could be used in a trade for Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), but Henry replies ""They'll never give you Walt"". Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) offers to accompany Jack in his attempt to negotiate with the Others. Ana gives Jack a gun and advises him to take someone with him. Locke tries to speak to Henry through the armory door, asking him whether or not he entered the numbers into the computer. However, Henry doesn't respond, only smirking to himself. Jack and Kate trek through the jungle. Kate notices a doll on the ground, and reaches to pick it up, despite Jack's frantic cries to stop. Kate picks up the doll and both she and Jack become ensnared in a net. They determine the trap is Danielle Rousseau's (Mira Furlan) due to its lower level of sophistication, and attempt to free themselves. Kate reaches around Jack to get the gun, and they try to shoot the rope suspending them in the air. Jack succeeds. Now free, Jack and Kate continue to march through the jungle, through a heavy rain. Jack asks Kate to explain her earlier comment about the lack of sophistication in the net. Kate tells him about her expedition with Claire to the other hatch. Jack and Kate arrive at the place where his standoff with the Others occurred. He calls out into the jungle, challenging them to show themselves. He becomes increasingly animated as he calls for the Others, but receives no response. In the jungle, Kate apologizes for kissing Jack, but Jack reveals that he is not sorry about the moment. A man comes stumbling out of the jungle carrying a torch. He falls to the ground in front of the two, and is turned over, revealing him to be an unconscious Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau). In the initial plans for the series, Jack was going to die midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge as the leader of the survivors.[2] Kate's backstory was that her husband went to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air, and on the Island she would remain adamant that he was alive.[2] However the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader and creating a new backstory for Kate.[2] They liked Kate's original backstory though, so they used it for Rose, and created Bernard as her husband.[2]L. Scott Caldwell's husband was going through health problems during the shooting of the first season, which was the inspiration for the flashbacks in ""S.O.S."".[3] The couple's backstory was originally planned to be told during season three;[4] however during season two, the Lost writers wanted to tell the story of one of the background characters of the show.[5] As Rose and Bernard are the most prominent of these characters, and fans were keen to learn their backstory, they decided to do an episode focussing on the couple.[6] Following this episode, Caldwell did not think Rose's healing had anything to do with the Island and stated ""If she is cured, it's because she's willed it herself"".[7] After ""S.O.S."", Rose does not appear again until midway through the third season. The writers cited Caldwell and Sam Anderson's other projects as a reason for their absence.[8] The episode's premiere gained 15.68 million American viewers.[9] C. K. Sample III, of AOL's TV Squad, liked ""S.O.S."" because it showed ""two characters' back stories which we've all been longing to see"", comparing their relationship to that of Jack and Kate (Evangeline Lilly), and finding Rose's meeting with Isaac ""particularly interesting"".[10]Lost producer Leonard Dick called Rose and Bernard ""much-beloved characters"", and thought they did an ""excellent job"" in ""S.O.S."".[3]",4547,7.9
Two for the Road,2,20,Paul Edwards,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Christina M. Kim,Ana Lucia,2006-05-03,15.56,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_for_the_Road_(Lost),"""Two for the Road"" is the 20th episode of the second season of the American drama television series Lost, and the show's 45th episode overall. The episode was written by supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and producer Christina M. Kim, and directed by Paul Edwards. It first aired in the United States on May 3, 2006, on the American Broadcasting Company. In the episode, flashbacks reveal more about Ana Lucia's past, while in present time, Ana Lucia tries to get a gun to kill Henry, and Michael returns to the rest of the survivors. ""Two for the Road"" was generally well-received by critics who were shocked that Ana Lucia and Libby were killed off. The actresses Michelle Rodriguez and Cynthia Watros had widely publicized drunk driving charges several months before the airing of the episode, but the producers later claimed in several interviews that the deaths had been planned for over a year.[2] The episode was watched by 15.03 million American viewers, which represented a decrease compared to the previous year's rating.[3] Sarnoff and Kim were nominated for the Writers Guild of America (WGA) Award for Best Episodic Drama for writing the episode.[4] Flashbacks begin directly after Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) shooting Jason (Aaron Gold) in ""Collision"". Upon arriving at the police station the following day, Ana Lucia's mother Teresa Cortez (Rachel Ticotin) is suspicious of her daughter and questions her, causing Ana Lucia to quit the police department. While working at an airport, she meets Christian Shephard (John Terry) who hires her as a bodyguard for his trip to Australia. One night, Ana Lucia and a drunk Christian go to a home, where Christian demands to see his daughter from a blonde woman (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick). After seeing that the argument is getting out of control, Ana intervenes and pulls Christian back into the car. Ana Lucia eventually gets tired of Christian's antics and leaves him at a bar, where they briefly encounter Sawyer when Christian opens his car door. Ana goes to the airport , about to board Flight 815 and calls her mother, apologizing and telling her that she wishes to make things right. Teresa says she will be waiting for Ana Lucia in Los Angeles. In the present, Ana Lucia starts questioning Henry Gale in the hatch, but suddenly he attacks her, and is only stopped when John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) knocks him unconscious. Locke asks Henry why he attacked Ana Lucia, but has never tried to hurt him. Henry says that Locke is ""one of the good ones"". Although Libby (Cynthia Watros) advises Ana Lucia not to try to get revenge on Henry, she is determined and asks James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) for a gun, but is rejected. Ana Lucia returns and after Sawyer still refuses to give her a gun, she has sex with him, and is able to distract him long enough to steal the gun. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) return with Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau). Michael wakes up and tells everyone in the hatch that he tracked the Others down and found out that they are living worse off than the survivors. He also says that once he is healthy, he will organize a rescue mission to reclaim his son Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley). After Locke and Jack begin to plan a rescue mission for Walt, they realize that they need more guns, and go to Sawyer, who realizes that Ana Lucia has stolen his. Elsewhere, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) has planned a romantic picnic for himself and Libby, but Hurley gets lost and leads them back to the survivors' beach. There, he realizes that he forgot to pack a blanket and Libby offers to go back to the hatch to retrieve one. She also suggests that Hurley ask Rose and Bernard for some wine for the picnic, a suggestion that Hurley is delighted to hear. Meanwhile, back in the hatch, Michael asks Ana Lucia what is going on and she explains a few things: Sawyer has all the guns, Jack, Locke, and Kate left to get the guns, and they currently have one of the Others, Henry, in captivity inside the armory. She mentions that Henry tried to kill her earlier in the day and that although she was about to kill Henry, she was not able to pull the trigger. Michael offers to do it, but after she hands him the gun he turns around and shoots her dead. Libby walks in with the blankets and startles Michael causing him to shoot her too. Michael then walks into the armory where Henry is being held. Instead of shooting Henry, Michael shoots himself in the arm. ""Two for the Road"" was the second episode of the series directed by Paul Edwards. Edwards had previously directed the episode ""What Kate Did"". The episode was written by Elizabeth Sarnoff and Christina M. Kim, the third episode that the two had written together. Numerous locations on Oahu were used as filming locations for the episode. The rooftop on Dole Cannery was filmed as the Los Angeles Police Department rooftop. The kitchen of Hawaii Convention Center was altered so that the Lost cast and crew could use it as a morgue, the Convention Center was also used for the airport scenes. The bar that Christian Shephard went to in the flashbacks is actually the Fisherman's Wharf restaurant at Kewalo Basin Harbor. The scene at Ana Lucia's hotel room was filmed at the Renaissance Ilikai Waikiki Hotel. The scenes on the beach were shot at Oahu's Papa'iloa Beach as usual.[5] The deaths of Ana Lucia and Libby caused speculation that they were killed off due to the DUIs that actresses Michelle Rodriguez and Cynthia Watros received within fifteen minutes of each other on December 1, 2005. Watros pleaded guilty, was fined $370, and had her license suspended for 90 days. Rodriguez initially pleaded innocent, but in April pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to five days in Oahu correctional facility, but ended up serving only 65 hours due to jail overcrowding.[6] In February 2006, US Weekly claimed that an insider told them that the Lost producers were frustrated with Rodriguez's behavior and were going to kill her character off.[7] Soon after, ""Two for the Road"" aired, writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse told TV Guide that when talking to Rodriguez about the part of Ana Lucia, she said that she would be interested, but only for a year. After sitting down with her, the two were very impressed with her energy, and decided to adjust their plan to make her character only last one season.[2] Since audiences had a negative reaction to Ana-Lucia, the producers thought her death would not generate enough sympathy from fans, so they decided that Libby, who was well liked, should also be killed for emotional impact.[8] Lindelof recalled that after they found out that both Rodriguez and Watros got the DUIs, he was concerned that it would look like killing Ana and Libby was the producers attempt to say ""Don't drive drunk!"", and even considered re-writing the script so it wouldn't seem that way, but the producers decided just to keep it like it was. Lindelof also denied rumors that Rodriguez was killed off because she was hard to deal with, saying that Michelle was ""totally professional and got along well with all the other actors."" According to Lindelof and Cuse, Watros was very sad about Libby being killed off, and the producers felt bad for her, so they helped her get in a pilot for a show on CBS called My Ex-Life, although it was not picked up by the network.[2][9] ""Two for the Road"" was viewed by 15.03 million American viewers, which was 1.5 million fewer than the ratings compared to the previous year.[3] The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. TV Squad's C. K. Sample wrote that ""Two for the Road"" was ""a great episode that I thoroughly enjoyed"", although he did feel ""badly for Sawyer and Hugo"". Sample also wrote that although he suspected that Ana-Lucia and Libby were going to die, he thought what ""was amazing was who shot them"".[10] Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com wrote that the episode contained the ""Biggest ... twist ... ever."" Slocum went on to say that if you had not seen the episode, ""whoooeee [sic] are you in for a treat"", and called the two murders ""a doozy"".[11] Slocum called Ana Lucia ""a drama queen"". He also felt that Libby's death was ""one of the most tragic things we've seen"", and said that it was ""equivalent to a nuclear weapon wiping out all the characters in the M*A*S*H finale.[11]Television Without Pity graded the episode with a B+.[12] Supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and producer Christina M. Kim were nominated for the Writers Guild of America (WGA) Award for Best Episodic Drama at the February 2007 ceremony for writing the episode.[4]",5021,8.9
?,2,21,Deran Sarafian,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,Mr. Eko,2006-05-10,16.35,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F_(Lost),"""?"", typically pronounced ""Question Mark"" is the 46th episode of Lost and the 21st episode of the second season. The episode was directed by Deran Sarafian, and written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. It first aired on May 10, 2006, on ABC. The character of Mr. Eko is featured in the episode's flashbacks. Eko is a priest in Australia. An associate gives him a counterfeit passport before he is sent to investigate a miracle of a drowned young girl named Charlotte, coming back to life on the autopsy table. At first, it appears that the miracle is genuine. Eko then consults the girl's father, Richard Malkin, the psychic that Claire visited in ""Raised by Another"". Malkin claims that the girl survived naturally (probably thanks to the mammalian diving reflex, which is more pronounced in young individuals), and that Charlotte and her mother are simply pretending that there was a miracle because they resent the fact that he is a fraudulent psychic. Eko reports that a miracle did not take place. In the final flashback, Eko, about to board Flight 815 , is confronted by Charlotte at the airport, who tells him that she saw Yemi while she was between the worlds and that his brother is proud of him. Angered, Eko starts to yell at Charlotte, who is interrupted by Libby, asking if everything was all right. Charlotte tells Eko that he'll see Yemi again. In a dream, Mr. Eko is chopping wood with his axe on the beach. He has visions of Ana Lucia and his brother, Yemi, saying that he must help John, who has ""lost his way"", by having John take him ""to the question mark"". Michael (who had just freed Henry after shooting Ana-Lucia, Libby, and his own arm) stumbles out of the hatch, claiming that he has been shot in the arm by a person unknown to him (knowing they would think it was Henry). Sawyer, Kate, and Jack discover the shooting victims — Ana-Lucia is dead, and Libby is near death. When Michael realises that Libby is still alive, he is fearful that she will reveal the truth of what actually happened; Jack asks Sawyer for the heroin to 'make Libby comfortable'. He also asks Kate to go with him, giving him the choice of disclosing the location of the guns, or allowing Libby to die painfully. Sawyer resentfully agrees, and the guns turn out to be in a secret compartment inside his tent. Eko offers to track down Henry Gale, with the assistance of Locke, but after they have left he reveals that his real goal is to force Locke to take him to the question mark, where they discover the burnt plane containing Yemi. They camp at the site, and Locke has a dream in which Yemi is on top of the nearby cliff. After he wakes up, Eko climbs the cliff and from the top looks down and is able to see a giant question mark etched in the grass adjacent to the plane. He climbs back down, and with Locke's help pushes aside the plane to find a hatch hidden underneath. Inside the hatch, there are chairs, TV monitors, and pneumatic tubes. Locke places his map in one of the tubes and it is swept away. Locke also finds another computer terminal with a command prompt: "">: PRINT LOG? Y/N"". Locke inputs Y, and a nearby dot-matrix printer begins to print out what appears to be an extensive list of timestamps. Eko also finds another Orientation movie of the Dharma Initiative from 1980, narrated by Dr. Marvin Candle, now going by the name of "" Mark Wickmund "" , where it is revealed that the hatch they are in is ""Station 5: The Pearl"", and it was made to observe the other station(s) and record how the subjects react to things of great importance. Wickmund reveals that those in the other hatches are undergoing a psychological experiment and the pneumatic tubes are used to send information back to the DHARMA Initiative. Locke thinks that he has been played a fool, and does not believe the button to have any use. However, Mr. Eko believes that pushing the button is highly important, and he will continue to do so if Locke stops. At the Swan, Hurley requests to speak to Libby, and he tearfully apologizes to her for forgetting the blankets. In her dying breath, she says, ""Michael!"", with a look of terror in her eyes. Jack, mistaking her horror as fear for Michael's safety, assures her that Michael is fine. Hurley starts to cry, as does Kate, Sawyer hugs Kate and she cries in his arms. Locke and Mr. Eko are seen making their way back to The Swan, as the timer starts to sound, the numbers needing to be entered into the computer; the episode ends with Michael in the armory, looking gravely toward the doorway, his plan unfolding. This episode marks main character Libby's death, originally thought to be dead in the previous episode. She was the fourth main character to die in the series thus far (the others being Boone Carlyle (played by Ian Somerhalder), Shannon Rutherford (played by Maggie Grace) and Ana Lucia Cortez (played by Michelle Rodriguez)). Despite this, Cynthia Watros is still credited as a series regular throughout the season and as a guest star (not a special guest star) onwards. Darren Aronofsky was scheduled to direct the episode, but declined after his wife Rachel Weisz got pregnant, being replaced by Deran Sarafian. Writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse called the episode ""a great opportunity for us to finally put Locke and Mr. Eko together, sort of a philosophical battle of faith and will that we've been hinting at all season long.""[1] 16.35 million American viewers watched the episode live.[2]",4760,8.8
Three Minutes,2,22,Stephen Williams,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Michael,2006-05-17,14.67,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Minutes,"""Three Minutes"" is the 47th episode of Lost. It is the 22nd episode of the second season. The episode was directed by Stephen Williams, and written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. It first aired May 17, 2006, on ABC. The emotionally conflicted character of Michael Dawson is featured in the episode's flashbacks. It also marks a transition for Mr. Eko, from his project of building a church, to his self-appointed role of entering the numbers in the computer.[2] Thirteen days ago, Michael asks Locke for a gun. Though Locke cooperates, Michael knocks him unconscious, and then heads to the computer to receive directions on how to find his son, Walt. Jack arrives unexpectedly; Michael confronts him and locks both him and Locke in the armory, before setting off to rescue Walt. En route he is captured by the Others and is taken to another location. He is then greeted by Mr. Friendly and various Others, shortly before the former's encounter with the survivors in ""The Hunting Party"". When alone with Michael, Alex tells him that Mr. Friendly is just sending them a message to scare them. She then asks Michael about Claire and her baby. Michael is dragged to the Others' camp, where they appear to live in makeshift tents. A woman identifying herself as ""Ms. Klugh"" asks questions about Walt's childhood. She eventually explains that she wants Michael to return to his camp to free Henry Gale. Michael demands to see Walt, and she agrees, giving him three minutes to talk. Michael is then reunited with his son. Walt informs Michael that they make him take ""tests"", and he cautions Michael that the Others are ""not who they say they are"". Ms. Klugh threatens Walt by telling him that he will be sent to ""The Room"" if he says anything revealing, and Walt is subsequently taken away after throwing himself at Michael, begging him to save him. Ms. Klugh tells Michael that he and Walt will be set free if he brings four people from his own camp to the Others. She gives him a slip of paper, which contains the names: Jack, Kate, ""James Ford"" (Sawyer), and Hurley. She states that Michael must bring his companions back if he is ever to see Walt again. Michael agrees, but also demands that he and Walt are given the boat in return. Michael debates with the other survivors as to who should accompany him to the Others' camp. He does not tell them about his instructions, but insists on limiting the number to the names that were on the paper. When Sawyer informs Michael that he has recruited Sayid, Michael protests and directly tells Sayid that he is not coming. Michael also fails to convince Hurley to go, despite reminding him that Libby was killed. Sayid suspects that Michael has been ""compromised"" by the Others, and decides to work on a new plan with Jack to try and regain an advantage. On the beach, Charlie brings a DHARMA kit, containing vaccine and a pneumatic injector, to Claire for her and Aaron to use. Later, Charlie struggles to construct the church, as Vincent approaches with a Virgin Mary statue, which contains heroin. Charlie follows Vincent back to Sawyer's hidden stash and discovers the other statues. Charlie decides to throw all of them into the ocean and Locke observes that Charlie has overcome his demons. During the funeral for Libby and Ana Lucia, while the survivors stand around their graves, Locke cuts away his splints and starts walking without crutches again. After saying a few words about Libby, Hurley tells a visibly relieved Michael that he is going to join his expedition to the Others' camp. At this point, the funeral is interrupted by Sun suddenly spotting a boat coming towards the island. 14.67 million Americans watched the episode live.[3]IGN ranked it as the 60th best episode, and noted that it was one of the few that took place entirely on the island, including the flashbacks.[2]",4485,8.5
"Live Together, Die Alone",2,23,Jack Bender,Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof,Desmond,2006-05-24,17.84,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Together,_Die_Alone","""Live Together, Die Alone"" is the second season finale of the ABC television series Lost, consisting of the 23rd and 24th episodes of the second season. It is also the 48th and 49th episodes overall. The episode was written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, and directed by Jack Bender. It first aired in the United States on May 24, 2006, on the American Broadcasting Company. The episode was watched by 17.84 million people and received positive reviews. In the episode, flashbacks reveal how Desmond came to the island. In realtime, Desmond unintentionally returns to the beach and is enlisted by Locke to help him stop the button in the hatch from being pushed. Meanwhile, several castaways head off to rescue Michael's son, Walt, from the Others. Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) is being released from a military prison in 2001 with a dishonourable discharge, for unknown reasons. Upon leaving, he runs into Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) who reveals that he prevented communication between his daughter Penelope (Sonya Walger) and Desmond while he was in prison, and strongly warns Desmond against attempting to reform a relationship. Desmond, wanting to prove that he is not a coward, travels to the United States from the United Kingdom to train for a sailing race around the world, sponsored by Widmore. He meets Libby (Cynthia Watros) in a cafe, and after a deep conversation, Libby gives Desmond a yacht owned by her late husband. While Desmond is training, Penny tracks him down and angrily questions him. (There is a moment in the background where Jack is seen arriving at the stadium to run.) Desmond tells her that he is determined to win Widmore's race and promises that he will return. However, while sailing, Desmond gets caught in a bad storm, and washes up on the island. He is rescued by a man in a yellow HAZMAT suit, Kelvin Inman (Clancy Brown) (who also is the American intelligence officer that releases Sayid in one of his flashbacks) who takes him to the Dharma Initiative Swan Station and shows him the Orientation film. He explains that it was edited by Radzinsky, his former partner who faked a lockdown event and created an invisible map on the blast doors with him and then committed suicide while Inman was asleep. Inman also explains that the incident was a ""leak"" of electromagnetic energy from the Swan that builds up and has to be discharged by pushing the button unless someone accesses a fail-safe and ""blows the dam"".Desmond lives together with Kelvin for three years before he finds out that Inman is secretly planning on escaping the island using Desmond's boat. Desmond violently confronts Inman about this, accidentally killing him in the process. After almost letting the countdown timer run down and causing a ""System Failure"", Desmond starts drinking liquor and a few days later, contemplates suicide. Before he shoots himself however, he hears John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) banging on the hatch door, and turns on a light. Desmond then realizes that there is still hope and decides not to kill himself. While at the funeral for Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby, a boat comes into view out at sea. Jack, Sayid, and Sawyer swim out to it and climb onto the boat. They hear music coming from inside it. Shots are fired from inside the boat through the boat hatch entrance. After breaking the hatch open, they find a drunken Desmond piloting the boat. The next day, after Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) prevents Locke from destroying the computer that controls the timer, Locke enlists Desmond's help in letting the timer run down to zero. Desmond hotwires the blast doors shut, locking Eko outside the computer room and Desmond and Locke inside of it. Eko, distraught, seeks Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) help. The two attempt to use dynamite to blow the blast door open, but the blast doors are unscathed, while they are both injured. Meanwhile, Desmond and Locke discuss the purpose of the stations and discover that when Desmond accidentally caused the ""System Failure"", the magnetic force pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island, thus causing the crash. Locke continues to doubt that the timer has any meaning, but Desmond assures him that it is all real. As the timer passes zero,causing another ""System Failure"", Desmond retrieves the failsafe key he obtained from Inman and crawls underneath the hatch, saying he will ""blow the dam"".After he turns the key in the system termination switch, a shrill humming noise and violet-white light envelops the entire island, causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike on opposite sides of the island to bend in apparent pain. That night, Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch; the whereabouts of Desmond, Eko, and Locke are not revealed. Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors. The survivors split up into two groups to head to the Others' camp. Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) walk on land to the camp, bringing guns and ammunition with them. Meanwhile, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) plan to use Desmond's sailboat to go by sea. Sayid plans to use black smoke as a signal, saying that ""this time, they will know that we are coming"", a reference to the attacks in the first-season finale. When the boat reaches the Others' camp, Sayid finds it to be deserted. Meanwhile, Michael, Jack, Sawyer, Hurley and Kate engage in a gun battle with some Others that were following them, and Sawyer kills one. Jack confronts Michael about leading the group into a trap, and Michael confesses to the murders of Ana Lucia and Libby. They realize that Michael has led them to a location other than the beach, ruining their former plan to meet up with Sayid. There, they see a large pile of pneumatic tubes, suggesting that the reports sent out from the monitoring hatch discovered in the episode ""?"" had never been read. Shortly after the discovery of the tube pile, they hear whispers, and suddenly Sawyer, Kate, and Jack are incapacitated by electric darts. The hostages, bound and gagged, are brought to a dock, where it appears that the Others are led by Henry Gale (Michael Emerson). Gale keeps his bargain with Michael, returning his son, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), to him and giving them an old fishing boat with instructions to sail on a heading of 325 degrees until they are rescued. Michael threatens Henry that he could tell the outside world of the island's location. Henry responds by telling him that it wouldn't matter as they would not be able to find the island, should they return. He also gives Michael a counter-threat: if he did tell people of the island's location, people would know what he did to get his son back. Michael reluctantly accepts but asks who Henry and his people are, to which Henry responds ""We're the good guys, Michael"". Michael uses the boat to get him and Walt off the island. Hurley is then released and sent back to the other survivors with a message that they are to stay away from the Others' part of the island. As Hurley is let go, the other three captives are taken away. The scene shifts to a cramped research station somewhere far from the island, in a polar climate; two Portuguese-speaking men who are playing chess are interrupted by an alert on a monitor displaying the message "">/ 7418880 Electromagnetic Anomaly Detected"" (the number 7418880 being the product of the numbers, 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42). One of the men makes a frantic phone call that wakes up Penelope in the middle of the night, telling her, ""I think we've found it."" ""Live Together, Die Alone"" was the thirteenth episode of the series directed by Jack Bender. The episode was written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, the ninth episode that the two had written together. Due to being two hours long, more time went into shooting ""Live Together, Die Alone"" than most episodes. It was shot in 17 days by two separate crews. Several scenes had to be shortened or cut due to time constraints. One scene that was cut was: after it is revealed that Michael was a traitor, Sawyer wanted to go back to the camp, because he thought it would be stupid to keep following someone who lied to him.[2] In the past, Lost has had an issue with spoilers being leaked from the set, so for the production of ""Live Together, Die Alone"", the crew took extra steps to ensure secrecy of pivotal scenes. Alex Petrovitch, who played Henrik, recalled that when auditioning for his part ""names, places, and circumstances (of his scene) were shifted so that you couldn’t link the scene to the show."" Even other cast members were not told about Petrovitch's scene. Another measure used by the cast and crew to limit the release of spoilers was calling the final scene by the code name ""Challah"" instead of referencing anything in the scene.[2] However, the attempts to cover up the flashback scenes were less successful and a call sheet was leaked by Lost fan Ryan Ozawa onto the internet, detailing the full plotlines of Desmond's flashbacks, about a month before the episode aired.[3] It is in this episode that it is revealed that Henry Gale is in fact the leader of the Others. ""Live Together, Die Alone"" received a 7.6 in the ages 18–49 demographic in the Nielsen ratings. The episode was watched by 17.84 million viewers.[4] ""Live Together, Die Alone"" has been generally well received. IGN's Eric Goldman praised actor Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond Hume) for giving ""a likable, sympathetic performance"". Goldman went on to say that the episode ""was a much better finale than last season"", and that it contained one of the ""more interesting flashbacks of the entire season"".[5]Entertainment Weekly writer Scott Brown described his viewing experience as ""I was up, I was down, I was frustrated, I was thrilled, and finally I was...well, a bit numb.""[6] Brown criticized the way Charlie reacted to the hatch explosion, stating that he felt the writers were trying to ""get us to hate Charlie"".[6] Deathcore band, Veil of Maya have a song named ""Namaste"", in which the song's chorus has the lyric ""Live together, die alone"" referencing the episode. The song's breakdowns are also actually written in-key the series' mythic numbers (4 8 15 16 23 42).[7]",7026,9.4
A Tale of Two Cities,3,1,Jack Bender,Damon Lindelof & J. J. Abrams,Jack,2006-10-04,18.82,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities_(Lost),"""A Tale of Two Cities"" is the third season premiere, and 50th episode overall, of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC)'s serial drama television series Lost. The episode was written by co-creators/executive producers J. J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof, based on a story by Lindelof and directed by executive producer Jack Bender.[2] The episode begins with the introduction of Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) and The Barracks. The character of Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. This is the only episode of the series other than the pilot to have been co-written by J. J. Abrams. When the episode first aired on October 4, 2006, in the United States, it was watched by an average of 19 million American viewers, making it the fourth most watched episode of the week.[3] It premiered to generally positive reviews, with many praising Mitchell's new character. In Jack's flashbacks, Jack is going through a divorce from his wife Sarah (Julie Bowen). He demands to know who she has been dating, but she refuses to tell him, so he spies on her and steals her cell phone. He proceeds to call every number in her phone, and his father Christian Shephard's (John Terry) cell phone rings. After following Christian to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Jack accuses him of sleeping with his wife and physically attacks him. After Jack is arrested, Sarah pays his bail. She tells him Christian is no longer sober, and also tells him ""now [he has] something to fix."" She then leaves with an unidentified man. New character Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) prepares for a book club meeting in a modern suburban home. The club is in a heated discussion of Stephen King's Carrie,[4][5] when they are interrupted by what sounds like an earthquake. The group leaves Juliet's house and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), previously known as ""Henry Gale"" to the survivors, appears along with Ethan Rom (William Mapother), looking up to watch Oceanic Flight 815 break apart in mid-air. Ben quickly orders Goodwin (Brett Cullen) and Ethan to join the survivors, stay undercover, and provide ""lists in three days."" The camera zooms out to reveal that the suburb is actually on the Island and is inhabited by The Others, while in the background the smoke trail of the midsection and tail section of Flight 815 can be seen. Back in the present, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) wakes up on the floor of a locker room. Tom (M.C. Gainey) allows her to have a shower and afterwards, forces her to change into a dress, after which she is led to an elegant breakfast on the beach with Ben, who tells her to put on handcuffs before she can eat. She asks him why he is doing this, and he tells her that he wanted to give her something pleasant to remember, as the next two weeks will be ""very unpleasant"". James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) wakes up in a cage in the jungle. A teenager, Karl (Blake Bashoff), in a nearby cage initially ignores Sawyer but then later expresses interest in Sawyer's camp and unlocks his cage then Sawyer's. However, they are both caught and Tom makes Karl, who is now beaten and bloody, apologize to Sawyer before taking the teen away. Sawyer figures out the mechanical puzzle in his cage, though Tom says it ""only took the bears two hours."" Kate is then put in Karl's (now empty) cage. Jack wakes up in a cell in the Hydra Station, where Juliet gently interrogates him. At one point Jack attacks her and attempts to escape, holding an improvised weapon at her throat. He orders her to open a door, but she refuses to comply, claiming that doing so would kill them both. Ben appears and agrees that opening the door will kill them all. Jack throws Juliet away, and then opens the door. As Ben dashes back through the door he came in, water starts rushing into the hallway. Juliet helps Jack struggle into an adjoining room, tells him to push a button which she had previously mentioned was for emergencies. He does so and she knocks him unconscious. When he awakes, she shows Jack a file which she says contains documents about his entire life. Juliet asks Jack if he has any questions about Sarah. After a pause, he asks, ""Is she happy?"" Juliet replies yes, and walks outside, and Ben congratulates her on a job well done. ""A Tale of Two Cities"" was the first episode to introduce the character of Juliet.[6] The actress who plays her, Elizabeth Mitchell, was cast in late July 2006 as a new series regular,[6][7] who was meant to be a possible love interest for Jack.[8][9] Mitchell has commented her first or second day of shooting was the opening sequence, when the Others watched Oceanic 815 fall out of the sky. When she first met actor Matthew Fox they briefly introduced themselves, but most of their initial conversation was in regard to the script and their characters. Mitchell found this helpful while shooting the premiere's scenes, since then they knew the other as their characters, and not as Matthew and Elizabeth. The scene in which Jack yells at Juliet, and she responds ""No Jack, I think you're stubborn"", was used as her audition scene.[6] One of the Others, Amelia, was played by the elderly Julie Adams, who was the protagonist in Creature from the Black Lagoon.[6][10] Previous guest actors William Mapother, Julie Bowen, M.C. Gainey, Brett Cullen, and John Terry made brief appearances in the episode. The premiere marked the first appearances of recurring guest actors Blake Bashoff and Stephen Semel.[10] In addition to Mitchell's new billing, only four other characters of star billing appeared in the episode: Michael Emerson, depicting Ben Linus, was promoted to a main character for the third season;[10][11] the other three were Matthew Fox playing Jack Shephard, Evangeline Lilly as Kate Austen and Josh Holloway as Sawyer.[12]Henry Ian Cusick was also promoted to a main character as Desmond Hume,[13][14] along with new characters Nikki and Paulo, played by Kiele Sanchez and Rodrigo Santoro respectively.[15]Malcolm David Kelley (Walt Lloyd), Harold Perrineau (Michael Dawson),[16][17]Michelle Rodriguez (Ana Lucia Cortez), and Cynthia Watros (Libby) were no longer credited as main characters after each of their characters were written out at the end of the previous season.[18][19] Co-creators and executive producers Damon Lindelof and J. J. Abrams wrote the premiere's teleplay based upon a story by Lindelof.[10] The episode was Abrams' first Lost writing credit since the pilot.[12] They laid out the third season with the idea of ""us versus them""; Carlton Cuse, a showrunner, explained, ""And who is us? And who is them? I mean I think we all tend to objectify people who we don't know much about and I think that's the audience's view of The Others right now -- they are bad, they are the malevolent force on the island. But over the course of the stories we're going to be telling this season on the show we expect the audience's view of The Others to change a lot.""[20] The opening sequence of the episode was meant to replicate the same idea of season 2's premiere ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"", where what seems to be a flashback is instead set on a new part of the island.[21] Director Jack Bender questioned what Jack's goal was when he pulled on the chain, but Lindelof told him not to worry, because ""Fox will sell it, and he did"".[6] Lindelof described when Jack attacks his father at the AA meeting as ""pot-committed... it basically means you put so much money on the bluff, you can't fold your cards"".[6] The scene with Kate in a dress was inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Belloq gives a dress for Marion Ravenwood to wear, and was intended to make ""tom-boyish"" Kate feel vulnerable.[6] The title, inspired by Charles Dickens' eponymous novel, refers to the reveal of another ""city"" on the island with the place where the Others live, in addition to the castaways' beach camp.[22] The episode has only three characters of the second season's main cast, Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Lindelof later described this limited scope as ""a mistake, when the audience is away from the show for that long, they want to see everybody"", causing the following season openers to have scenes with most of the main characters.[23] In the episode, Tom tells Kate that she is not his type.[24] This comment resulted in online discussion in regard to Tom's sexual orientation,[5][25][26] and Lindelof and Cuse hinted that a Lost character would later be outed.[27] Gainey joked, ""if [Kate's] not your type, you're gay"", and began playing the character as such.[28] After the broadcast of ""Meet Kevin Johnson"", Lindelof and Cuse confirmed that the line from the third-season premiere is an allusion to Tom's sexuality, but felt that it needed to be explicitly confirmed in the show, although Lindelof noted that the confirmation scene in ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" ""was not subtle, to say the least"".[29] The beginning of the episode featured a scene where Juliet and Amelia discuss Ben's feelings for Juliet, which was shot but deleted.[6] This scene was later made into the twelfth ""Lost: Missing Pieces"" mobisode, ""The Envelope"".[30][31] The exterior of the Hydra was shot in an abandoned theme park, which art director Andrew Murdock thought it fit as a location for the ""kind of blocky, 80's-style architecture"", where everything was ""aged, industrial, and a little bit larger, and a little bit unusual"".[32] The opening sequence features Petula Clark's ""Downtown"", a song that would later be used in another third-season episode featuring Juliet. Another song heard in the premiere, ""Moonlight Serenade by Glenn Miller, was first used in the season two episode ""The Long Con"".[33] Lindelof has stated the songs they choose for Lost were often inspired from his childhood, when his mother would vacuum to music on Sundays.[6] On its original broadcast in the United States on ABC, the premiere was watched by an estimated 18.82 million viewers,[34] making it the most watched episode of the night[35] and the fourth most watched of the week.[36] ""A Tale of Two Cities"" had four million less viewers than the previous season premiere.[37] In Canada, the episode was watched by 1.972 million viewers on CTV, easily winning its timeslot.[38] In the United Kingdom, ""A Tale of Two Cities"" was broadcast on November 22 along with follow-up ""The Glass Ballerina"" in Lost's first broadcast after changing to Sky1.[39] With 1.549 million viewers, it was most watched program of the week on the non-terrestrial channels.[40] IGN's Chris Carabott rated the premiere 9/10, calling the ""peek into the life of The Others... exceptionally done"" and the non-appearance of the other survivors ""a smart move"".[12] Carabott also praised Jack's flashbacks, writing ""Previously, Jack has been written as the white knight and reluctant hero who everyone looked to in their time of need. The more chinks they show in Jack's armor, the better - the more human he becomes.""[12] He called ""Juliet... a promising new character who will hopefully add a new dimension to The Others this season"" and concluded his review by calling the episode ""a solid season opener"".[12] Robert Bianco from USA Today praised the opening scene and called the episode ""a fine start for a great series"" but with reservations.[41] Bianco wished Jack would ""win one again for the team"", and was fearful that Lost could eventually become like Alias, ""a series that became so entranced by its puzzle and its villains that it let the main characters vanish behind them"".[41] On a list of Lost episodes, the Los Angeles Times ranked ""A Tale of Two Cities"" number 66 out of 113 episodes, explaining it was ""Not bad. The introduction of Juliet is a killer, and Jack raging against the Others is fun. But many of the big revelations -- Ben's name, for example -- aren't very well handled.""[42] On a similar list, IGN ranked the episode at number 38; they called the opening ""one of the show's characteristic fake-outs"", and Jack's flashbacks ""not nearly as interesting as his first encounters with Juliet"".[7] Matthew Fox submitted this episode for consideration for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.[43]",5429,8.7
The Glass Ballerina,3,2,Paul Edwards,Jeff Pinkner & Drew Goddard,Sun & Jin,2006-10-11,16.89,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Ballerina,"""The Glass Ballerina"" is the second episode of the third season of the TV series Lost, and the 51st episode overall. The episode was written by Jeff Pinkner and Drew Goddard and directed by Paul Edwards, and premiered on October 11, 2006, on ABC. The characters of Sun and Jin are featured in the episode's flashbacks; on the Island, they and Sayid attempt to discover the whereabouts of Jack, Kate, and Sawyer. The episode was watched by an estimated 16.890 million viewers in the United States. It received mixed reviews, as multiple reviewers believed it was inferior to the previous week's season premiere; one stated the storyline caused the series to ""take a step back [because it] delivers nothing new or substantial"".[2] A young Sun-Hwa Kwon (Sophie Kim) breaks a glass ballerina and blames it on the maid, despite her father, Mr. Paik (Byron Chung), warning her the maid would be fired. Later, Sun as an adult (Yunjin Kim) is shown having an affair with Jae Lee (Tony Lee), who attempts to give her a pearl necklace. She refuses, afraid that her husband would see it. Then, to her shame, Mr. Paik barges in and finds them in bed together. Mr. Paik later summons Sun's husband, Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), saying that Jae has been stealing from him, and telling Jin to put an end to it (implying that he is to be killed). But when Jin ambushes and beats up Jae, he still cannot bring himself to commit murder, and instead orders Jae to leave the country. However, as Jin gets into his car, Jae's body suddenly lands on his windshield. Jae's corpse hand is clutching the pearl necklace, implying that he jumped from the window. At Jae's funeral, Sun runs into her father. She asks if he would ever tell Jin about the affair, but he says that it was not his place to tell Jin. On the sailboat, Sun, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) argue about what to do because Jack Shephard's (Matthew Fox) party has not shown up; Sun goes against her husband's wishes and agrees with Sayid to sail to a new location. They find the Others' dock and come ashore to build a signal fire to try and lure the Others into an ambush. Meanwhile among the Others, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) orders Colleen (Paula Malcomson) to put together a team and capture Sayid's boat. Her team avoids Sayid and Jin, and instead sneaks aboard the boat, where they encounter Sun below deck. Sun accidentally shoots Colleen in the abdomen and narrowly manages to escape overboard. Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) are forced to work in a quarry, digging and carrying rocks. Alex (Tania Raymonde) secretly asks Kate about Karl (Blake Bashoff). Sawyer creates a distraction by kissing Kate passionately, and steals a rifle, but is forced to relinquish it when Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) threatens to shoot Kate. Back in their cages, Sawyer tells Kate what he learned about the fighting abilities of the various Others. He says that Juliet would have shot her without a problem and criticizes the other Others. They start discussing plans to escape, not knowing Ben is monitoring their conversation via security cameras. Ben then visits Jack, telling him his real name, and that he has lived on the island all his life. He offers that if Jack cooperates, he can be sent home. Jack believes the Others are also stranded just as he is, but Ben informs him of the exact time and date of his plane crash and that 69 days have since passed (making the date November 29, 2004) and insists that they are in contact with the outside world. He shows this by citing various current events, such as the re-election of George W. Bush to the American presidency, the sudden death of Christopher Reeve and that the Boston Red Sox have won the 2004 World Series. Once Ben tells him about the Red Sox, Jack starts laughing and says that proves he is lying. Ben then proves it by playing a recording of the final play in the game as Jack watches in shock. Executive producer Jeff Pinkner and supervising producer Drew Goddard co-wrote ""The Glass Ballerina"",[3] while cinematographer Paul Edwards served as the director.[4] It featured recurring stars Byron Chung, Tony Lee,[4]Michael Bowen, and Tomiko Okhee Lee,[5] as well as the first of two appearances by guest actress Paula Malcomson.[4][6] Though her character Colleen Pickett is shot in the episode, she does not die until the season's fourth episode, ""Every Man for Himself"".[7] Leading up to the premiere of the new season, showrunners Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof foreshadowed the episode's adultery storyline in an interview; Cuse mentioned, ""How truthful has [Sun] been with Jin about her past?"", to which Lindelof added, ""And related to that, is the baby his?"".[8] Previously, a season two episode had seemed to confirm that Jin was infertile, leading to ramped up speculation online that Sun was pregnant by her lover Jae Lee.[9] A later episode in the third season would resolve this storyline, showing that Jin was cured of his infertility and is the father of their baby.[10] Sun's deception over the affair would later be resolved in the season four episode ""Ji Yeon"", when Juliet tells Jin about Sun and Jae Lee.[11] Actor Daniel Dae Kim enjoyed the fight scene between him and guest actor Tony Lee, commenting that ""I really appreciate the fact that [Jin]'s just a down-and-dirty street fighter. I think his style of fighting fits his character"".[12] He continued ""it was great to see a different layer to Sun's character. Because previously she had always been the good wife, and Jin was the bad husband"".[12] Actress Yunjin Kim added that ""now we know that [Sun]'s not what she's been advertised to be for the last two seasons, but actually she has a lot of secrets.""[12] It was originally scheduled to air on October 18, 2006, but was swapped with the episode ""Further Instructions"" and broadcast one week earlier.[13] When ""The Glass Ballerina"" first aired, it was the seventh most watched episode of the week in the United States, with 16.890 million viewers[14] and a 6.9 rating in the key demographic of adults ages 18–49.[15] The problem with ""The Glass Ballerina"" is that the episode is ultimately boring. The narrative offers very little excitement or anything that will further advance the overall story. Just as things start to get interesting towards the end of the episode - it's over. Yes, it's sad that Jin and Sun have suffered through some painful relationship problems, but if it's not going to have a direct impact on events, there is no reason it should be in the episode. The biggest complaint that Lost garners from its audience is that the show utilizes plenty of filler and very little substance. An episode like this reinforces that argument. —IGN reviewer Chris Carabott[2] Lost critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine noted that like the season premiere, the episode ""mostly serves to add uncomfortable wrinkles to one of the show's saints, going so far as to make the consistently sympathetic Sun quite unlikable.""[3] He added ""While I... question the need for the flashbacks, I must confess to finding this particular episode more wonderfully twisted than usual.""[3] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly wrote ""Last week's Jin/Sun episode was something of a disappointment, not because it was a bad episode of Lost, per se (I would give it a solid B), but because it wasn't as good as the exhilarating season premiere (which I would give an A+).""[16] IGN's Chris Carabott rated the episode 6.8/10, explaining that after the premiere's ""exciting, new direction"" of an episode, ""The Glass Ballerina"" helped Lost ""take a step back [as it] delivers nothing new or substantial"".[2] He felt the flashbacks were repetitive and ""a lot more like filler than the basis for compelling television"", but praised the final scene between Jack and Ben as ""the only compelling scene in the whole episode"".[2] On a list ranking all the Lost episodes, the Los Angeles Times ranked ""The Glass Ballerina"" 80 out of 110 episodes, explaining ""A good flashback (to Sun and her pre-island lover) and a terrific last scene -- wherein Jack learns the Sox won the Series -- can't make up for a listless on-island plot.""[17] On a similar list, IGN rated the episode 106 out of 113 episodes, writing ""it felt appropriate for Lost's third season to begin with an episode only featuring Jack, Sawyer and Kate, since their abduction by the Others was a big part of Season 2's conclusion. But having episode two of the season also focus so much on these three, with almost no plot momentum, was frustrating and rather uninteresting. Meanwhile, we do pick up with Sayid, Sun and Jin, but it's really only for yet another 'Sun and Jin have had a lot of big issues in their marriage' flashback – a topic we were well familiar with at this point.""[18] Daniel Dae Kim and Yunjin Kim each submitted this episode for consideration on their own behalf for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series respectively for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.[19]",4552,8.1
Further Instructions,3,3,Stephen Williams,Carlton Cuse & Elizabeth Sarnoff,Locke,2006-10-18,16.310000000000002,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_Instructions,"""Further Instructions"" is the third episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series Lost. It first aired on October 18, 2006, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), making it the 52nd episode of the series. The episode was written by showrunner Carlton Cuse and supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and was directed by Stephen Williams. The series follows the survivors of the crash of a commercial passenger jet flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, on a mysterious tropical island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean. In this episode, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) recovers from the Hatch implosion and rescues Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) from a polar bear. Locke is featured in the episode's flashbacks. The episode featured the return of previous main cast member Ian Somerhalder. It also introduced the characters of Nikki and Paulo (Kiele Sanchez and Rodrigo Santoro), who were added in the wake of some criticism that the series focused too much on the same fifteen survivors. An estimated 16.31 million Americans watched the episode upon its original broadcast. ""Further Instructions"" received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Locke is a member of a commune in Humboldt County, California. He considers its members his new family. One day Locke picks up a young hitchhiker, named Eddie Colburn (Justin Chatwin), who tells him he is leaving home. Eddie joins the commune, but after six weeks, he asks Locke why he is never allowed to know what is going on in a greenhouse (into which he sees an exceptional amount of fertilizer going). Eddie expresses his discontent with being kept out of the secret and affirms to Locke his desire to be in on ""whatever you guys are trying to blow up"". Locke laughs and says he will talk to the commune leaders, Mike (Chris Mulkey) and Jan (Virginia Morris). Upon entering the greenhouse some time later, in which marijuana is grown, Locke finds Mike and Jan in the midst of a frantic preparation to flee. They blame Locke for bringing Eddie, whom they have discovered is an undercover police officer. Locke promises to fix the situation. He takes Eddie hunting and holds Eddie at gunpoint. Eddie says that Locke was chosen because his psych profile said he would be ""amenable for coercion"". Eddie walks away, stating that Locke will not shoot him because he is ""a good man,"" though Locke insists that he is a hunter, not a farmer. John Locke wakes up in the jungle and sees a naked Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) run by, but Locke cannot speak. Mr. Eko's (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) stick falls from above nearly hitting him. In the frame of Eko's church, he builds a sweat lodge and convinces Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) to stand guard. Locke takes a hallucinogenic drug and enters the lodge in order to ""speak with the Island"". There, Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) appears to help him ""find [his] way again, so that [he] can bring the family back together"". Locke (mutely) apologizes for the day Boone died, and he accepts the apology, however, in a taunting and seemingly sarcastic manner. Locke's hallucination takes him to Sydney airport. Boone wheels Locke through the airport where he tells him someone is ""in serious danger"". Locke sees his fellow survivors, and is told by Boone that he must ""clean up [his] own mess"". Locke finds Eko's stick covered in blood and Boone tells him ""they have him, you don't have much time"". Upon exiting the sweat lodge he sees a flash of a polar bear. He recovers his ability to speak and tells Charlie that he is going to save Eko. Locke and Charlie track Eko, who Locke believes has been captured by a polar bear. They pause at a large pit in the ground where the hatch imploded. They encounter Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), who tells them that Jack, Kate, and Sawyer were kidnapped by the Others, and that ""Henry Gale"" is their leader. While continuing back to the camp alone, Hurley finds Desmond naked and lends him a tie-dyed t-shirt. Desmond says the electromagnetic anomaly may have been destroyed, and Hurley questions why Desmond was not destroyed. Desmond mentions Locke's speech and his plan to save Jack Shephard, Kate Austen, and James ""Sawyer"" Ford. However, Hurley responds, ""What speech?"", as Locke has yet to give any such speech. Desmond seems confused, and drops the whole matter. Locke finds the polar bear's cave and rescues Eko from the polar bear. While Charlie fetches water from a stream, Locke apologizes to an unconscious Eko for his lack of faith. Eko appears to briefly awaken and tells Locke that he must rescue Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Upon arriving at camp, Hurley informs the camp that Jack and the others have been captured. As an explanation, Locke announces to the survivors that he plans to rescue Jack, Kate, and Sawyer, as Desmond indicated to Hurley earlier. Hurley mentions to Charlie a sense of déjà vu. ""Further Instructions"" was written by showrunner Carlton Cuse and supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff; Stephen Williams served as the director.[2] As the third episode of the season, ""Further Instructions"" was the first episode to feature the fate of the main cast camped on the beach, as well as the first to begin resolving the Hatch storyline from the season two finale.[3] Leading up to the third season's broadcast, ABC attempted to reveal as few details as possible to the public. Ian Somerhalder's return was one piece of information that press releases included.[4] Somerhalder, a former series regular, was credited as a guest actor to play his character Boone Carlyle in Locke's hallucinations,[3] as his character died during the first season.[5] Guest star Justin Chatwin made his first and only appearance in the episode. Other guest stars included Virginia Morris and Chris Mulkey as the commune leaders Jan and Milke, and Dion Donahue as Kim.[6] The polar bear was mostly depicted by having stuntman Jonathan Arthur inside a bear suit.[7] Kiele Sanchez and Rodrigo Santoro make their first appearances as Nikki and Paulo in this episode. Prior to the third season, the producers of the show were often asked what the rest of the plane-crash survivors were doing because the show only focused on approximately fifteen of the survivors, and the characters of Nikki and Paulo were created in response.[8] Reaction to the characters was generally negative because of their abrupt introduction onto the show.[9] Nikki and Paulo's original introduction onto the show was deleted for time from the final cut of the episode.[10] They were supposed to be accidentally found by Claire Littleton in Jack's tent having sex in the middle of the episode.[11] They were instead introduced at the end of the episode when Locke makes a speech.[12] The deleted scene was included on the third season DVD.[13] The DVD also contained another deleted scene of Locke returning to the commune and seeing Mike and Jan getting arrested.[14] Hurley worries that the Hatch implosion turned Desmond into the Hulk, a Marvel Comics character who turned large and green upon being exposed to Gamma rays.[3][15] The Bible verses seen on Mr. Eko's stick include Romans 6:12, which says ""Do not obey the lusts of sin"" and John 3:5, which says ""Jesus answered, 'I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit'.""[16]Hurley's numbers are also partially visible.[16]Dominic Monaghan as his character Charlie, says, while trying to figure out who Locke needs to speak to: ""Trees? Yea I heard they are wonderful conversationalists"", a reference to Monaghan's work in The Lord of the Rings, in which he talks to trees. ""Further Instructions"" was originally scheduled to air October 11, 2006 as the second episode of the show's third season, but swapped with another Lost episode, ""The Glass Ballerina"".[17] Upon its original broadcast on October 18, 2006 in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC),[6] ""Further Instructions"" was watched live by an estimated 16.31 million viewers.[18] In the 18-49 demographic, Lost received a 6.5/16 ratings share, helping ABC place first for the night when compared to the other major networks.[19] The episode has received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Chris Carabott of IGN wrote that ""Further Instructions"" was ""an entertaining hour of television. The episode certainly offers its fair share of excitement, but as with any typical Lost episode we are presented with more questions than answers"".[20] Carabott also called it an improvement over the preceding episode, ""The Glass Ballerina.""[20] Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine expressed relief in having Locke ""back to the way we fondly remember him--as a wide-eyed, knife-wielding, face-smeared madman"", but disliked his flashbacks, calling them a ""largely under-developed affair"".[3] Dignan was also pleased to have Hurley back at the camp and referred to him as ""someone [who] will keep the show grounded"", but concluded his review by unhappily noting the sudden emergence of Nikki and Paulo as ""a colossal misjudgment on the producers' part"" and ""a dangerous precedent that bears keeping an eye on.""[3] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Christine Fenno believed the episode had ""false starts"" but still ""enjoyed the trippy places the writers took us.""[15] While disliking the initial scenes with Charlie and Locke, Fenno thought the episode ""found its groove"" after Locke entered into the trance, and called the final scene between Eddie and Locke the episode's ""strongest moment.""[15]The Record gave a negative review, noting that ""Unfortunately, 'Instructions' seemed devoid of everything that made 'The Glass Ballerina' hum. It was disjointed, it was graceless, and it seemed filled with gaping holes and not terribly helpful information.""[16] In a 2008 review, Ryan McGee of Zap2It gave the episode another negative review and considered it the weakest of the season's first three episodes. He explained that after watching it for a second time, it ""just feels off to me in hindsight. Maybe it's the lack of forward movement, maybe it's the lackluster flashback, maybe because the central plot is rendered moot in just two more episodes...I can't quite say.""[21]",4492,8
Every Man for Himself,3,4,Stephen Williams,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Sawyer,2006-10-25,17.09,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Man_for_Himself_(Lost),"""Every Man for Himself"" is the fourth episode of the third season of the American drama television series Lost, and the 53rd episode overall. It was directed by Stephen Williams and written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. It first aired on ABC in the United States on October 25, 2006. The character of Sawyer (Josh Holloway) is featured in the episode's flashbacks; on the island, his rebellious attitude causes Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) and the Others to conjure a plan to keep him in check. ""Every Man for Himself"" was intended to show how Ben was a character that could manipulate even the best confidence man on the island, and if Sawyer could care for another person, as Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is making her attempts to escape captivity. When the episode first aired, it was watched by 17.09 million American viewers. Reviews were polarized; some critics praised the writing and the cliffhanger ending, while others deemed the episode repetitive and the ""outright stinker"" of season 3's early episodes. Sawyer is in prison, trying to befriend Munson (Ian Gomez), a man who has hidden ten million dollars. He warns Munson that the warden (Bill Duke) is trying to con him out of his money. Eventually, Munson, worried that his wife will find where he has hidden the money, enlists Sawyer's help in moving the stash. Sawyer then reveals this information to the warden in exchange for a reduced sentence and a part of the money, which he puts in a bank account for Clementine Phillips, a baby that previous con victim Cassidy Phillips (Kim Dickens) has told him is his daughter. The warden sarcastically congratulates Sawyer on lying and cheating his way out of prison. As Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Sawyer watch, the Others carry a critically injured Colleen (Paula Malcomson), who was shot by Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) the night before. Sawyer realizes that the injury was inflicted by someone back at camp, and then devises a plan to break out from the cage; he intends to electrocute an off-guard Danny Pickett (Michael Bowen) using a puddle he created outside his cage. However, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) overhears him via surveillance and switches off the electricity prior to visiting him. When Sawyer attempts to carry out his plan, Ben knocks him unconscious and has him carried into the Hydra station. Sawyer wakes up to find himself strapped to a table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before having a large hypodermic needle inserted into his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben and Tom come in, Tom carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal. Meanwhile, Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) begs Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to help operate on Colleen. Upon arriving at the operating theatre, Jack notices some x-rays, but Juliet informs him that they are not Colleen's. During the surgery, Jack tries to save Colleen, but she eventually dies. Later, Jack informs Juliet that there was nothing they could do with Colleen, and then asks about the x-rays, which Jack knows belong to a 40-year-old man with a very large spinal tumor, and asks whom he is there to save. Danny, aware that the Oceanic Flight 815 survivors are responsible, takes his anger out on Sawyer by violently beating him; Sawyer refrains from fighting back. Kate pleads with him to stop; Danny ceases only after Kate admits to loving Sawyer. Afterwards, Kate notices a gap in her cage, and manages to climb through. She tries to free Sawyer, but he bitterly refuses, remembering Karl's escape and bloody capture. Kate returns to her cage, insisting that she would not abandon him, and tells Sawyer that she lied about loving him so that Danny would stop. The next day, Ben takes Sawyer for a walk to high ground. Sawyer learns that he has no pacemaker; it was merely a con to prevent Sawyer from leaving, and Ben shows him the same rabbit from the day before, which had been merely sedated. Ben reveals to Sawyer that they are on a completely different island approximately twice the size of Alcatraz that overlooks the main island; escape is impossible. Upon asking why he was conned, Ben tells Sawyer that in order to gain a con artist's respect, they must be conned themselves. Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) offers to fix Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) roof, but takes it back after Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) offers to do this himself. Desmond then uses one of Paulo's (Rodrigo Santoro) golf clubs to build a lightning rod next to Claire's hut. As a storm brews, waking up Aaron, then lightning strikes the golf club instead of Claire's hut, Charlie looks on in amazement, as, again, Desmond seemed to have had a glimpse of the future. Leading up to the episode's broadcast, showrunner Damon Lindelof asked in an interview, ""Until now, Sawyer's been the No. 1 con man on the island. What happens when he meets his match?"" Fellow showrunner Carlton Cuse added ""Is he willing to put himself out there emotionally for another human being?"".[2]Evangeline Lilly described the scene where Kate declines to escape as a major moment to the character, saying that ""due to this hillbilly she's capable of returning to her cage."" Josh Holloway agreed, declaring that the episode revealed to Sawyer that ""not everyone is evil"". The flashbacks were shot in an actual penitentiary, the Halawa Correctional Facility, which had been previously used for the prison where Desmond was incarcerated in ""Live Together, Die Alone"". While some of the interns were portrayed by extras with soy ink tattoos, bikers with actual body paint were also used.[3] Referring to the scene in which Ben seemingly fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Michael Emerson comments Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science.[4] He also described the events as a demonstration that ""Ben has more cards than you think; ... he's a step or two ahead, one layer or two deeper than anyone else who is playing the game"".[5] The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's On Writing,[6] where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number 8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer.[7] Emerson said that part of the appeal of the scene was that ""bunnies look so innocent, and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them"". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him – ""it was unfazed, it barely blinked"".[5] When asked in an interview whether she got sick of shooting on the Hydra holding cell set, Elizabeth Mitchell responded I guess so. It was creepy because it was supposed to be underwater, so it was a little bit dingy but kind of great at the same time ... what I will miss is just being one on one with another actor. And then also one on two obviously when it was Michael [Emerson] because the three of us, it was almost like being on stage. We were able to really work off of each other and I thought you don't usually get that in a TV show.[8] This episode attracted 17.087 million American viewers, standing as the seventh most watched program of the week.[9] IGN's Chris Carabott said that ""now that Lost has finally wrapped up most of the loose ends from season two, the episode can shift focus to this season's mysteries."" He also felt the episode ""offers a healthy mix of plot and character development with a fair share of revelations thrown in for good measure.""[10] Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly declared herself ""sold on the adrenaline-rush direction the show has taken"", with praise to the flashbacks and the cliffhanger involving the reveal of the second island.[11]Lost critic Andrew Dignan described ""Every Man for Himself"" as ""quite the exhilarating episode, packing in enough thrills to make the 42-minutes fly by"" in Slant Magazine.[12] Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it considered ""watching the con man get conned was brutally satisfying"", saying that Sawyer ""[ran] the whole gamut of emotions"", and felt Colleen's death and the reveal of Ben's tumor ""were good things, as people were already impatient by the glacial-like pace of Season 3.""[13] Writing for AOL TV, Jonathan Toomey considered ""Every Man for Himself"" as ""an interesting episode"" which set up many new elements, and while Toomey called the flashback ""a little dry and 100% predictable"", he liked how it related to the other events in the story ""right up to the title"".[14] Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com praised the episode for returning to the mythology, as he considered the previous episode lacked ""the slack-jawed wonder I'm so accustomed to experiencing with this show"".[15] Daniel MacEachern of Television Without Pity gave the episode a grade of B-.[16] IGN ranked ""Every Man for Himself"" 70th out of all episodes of Lost, saying that it ""offered plenty of food for thought.""[17] On the other hand, a similar list by Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the tenth worst of the series, describing it as the ""only outright stinker"" of early season 3.[18]Alan Sepinwall heavily criticized the episode for the repetitive and uninteresting storyline with the Others, though he praised Emerson's performance as Ben.[19]Michael Emerson and Josh Holloway submitted this episode for consideration on their own behalf respectively in the category of ""Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series"" at the 2007 Emmy Awards,[20] but neither was nominated.[21]",4548,8.4
The Cost of Living,3,5,Jack Bender,Alison Schapker & Monica Owusu-Breen,Mr. Eko,2006-11-01,16.07,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cost_of_Living_(Lost),"""The Cost of Living"" is the 5th episode of the third season of Lost, and the 54th episode overall. It aired on November 1, 2006, in the US, averaging 16.07 million viewers, and on December 5, 2006, in the UK, being watched by 1.15 million viewers. The episode was written by Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker and directed by Jack Bender. The plot centers on the character of Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), who in flashbacks shows how he became a priest replacing his dead brother Yemi (Adetokumboh M'Cormack), and in the present day events is haunted by visions of Yemi while other castaways decide to visit a Dharma Initiative station. The episode was written to finish Eko's character arc as Akinnuoye-Agbaje had requested to leave the show while finishing the second season. Reviewers subsequently praised ""The Cost of Living"" while considering that the departure of Eko made Lost lose one of its best characters. Shortly after the death of his brother Yemi, Eko is driven back to Yemi's village. Inside the church, Eko announces to the altar boy Daniel and his mother Amina that he will be taking his brother's place at the church. When Amina also inquires about Yemi's upcoming trip to London, a surprised Eko states that he would also replace him there. Some time later, after Eko has become established in his new role as priest, he is confronted by militiamen, who Amina reveals that had a deal with Yemi to get most of the clinic's vaccines. Eko soon develops a plan to sell the vaccine on the black market before he leaves the country that coming weekend. As the militiamen learn of Eko's deal, they attack him inside the church, but end up getting killed. The villagers respond by closing the church as they felt it was desecrated. Amina calls out Eko, saying she had been aware of the vaccine deal, and advises him to repent and make his peace with God, telling Eko that he ""owes"" Yemi one church. A delirious Eko has a vision of his brother Yemi (Adetokumboh M'Cormack) holding a cigarette lighter, who says it was Eko's time to confess his sins and, he knew where to find him. Afterwards, Eko's shelter catches fire, and Eko is rescued by Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia). As John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) arrives to ask what happened, Eko has vanished. The next morning, Locke suggests to Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) that he visit the Pearl station. Joined by Charlie, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Nikki and Paulo (Kiele Sanchez and Rodrigo Santoro), the group finds Eko on their way to the Pearl. Upon arrival, Eko does not find Yemi's body on the airplane atop the entrance, and decides to remain outside while Locke and the others enter the hatch. Inside the Pearl, Sayid tinkers first with the communication lines and, following a suggestion from Nikki, the monitors. Then one of the screens gets a live video feed of what appears to be another hatch, revealing a man with an eyepatch (Andrew Divoff) who then turns off the camera. Meanwhile, outside the Pearl, Eko sees Yemi and follows him into an open field, where Yemi tells him it is time for Eko to confess his sins. Eko says he has not sinned, having not chosen the life he was given and that Eko had only done what he needed to do to survive. An angry-looking Yemi replies, ""You speak to me as if I were your brother"" as he retreats into the jungle. Eko follows him asking ""Who are you?!"", and then finds the smoke monster. An arm of smoke attacks Eko, beating him into trees before he is slammed into the ground. Locke and the others rush out of the station to find a bloodied Eko. Locke approaches Eko, who whispers his dying words into Locke's ears. Sayid asks what he said, and Locke replies, ""We're next."" At The Hydra, Jack is invited by Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) to attend a memorial service being held for Colleen. On the way, Jack asks about the symptoms of Ben's spinal tumor, particularly pointing out that it will kill him. Ben professes not to know what Jack is talking about. Privately, Ben asks Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) why she showed his X-rays to Jack. Juliet replies that she never told Jack whose X-rays they were, and remarks that Ben must have inadvertently confirmed Jack's guess. The following day, Ben tells Jack that they had a perfect plan to convince Jack to operate on Ben's spine, but it failed when Jack saw the X-rays. Afterwards, Juliet brings to Jack's cell a movie, which consists of Juliet speaking through cue cards. As Juliet discusses how the surgery will proceed, on the tape she tells Jack that Ben is a liar and very dangerous, and thus the surgery should be intentionally botched to kill Ben, and that she will protect Jack if he does so. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje signed to Lost on a one-year contract, as he did not want to make a long-term commitment to the series. As Michelle Rodriguez signed under similar conditions that lead to her character Ana-Lucia Cortez only appearing in the show's second season, show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse negotiated with Akinnuoye-Agbaje to make his character, Mr. Eko, to appear in the third season as well, adding some space between the two character deaths to develop Eko's closure better.[2] As filming of season 2 ended, conversations between the actor and the writers ended setting Eko's departure during the first six episodes, prior to mid-season break, with ""a shocking and emotional death"".[3] To make sure the sequence was ""big and impressive"", effects supervisor Kevin Blank decided to set the death at the Jackass Ginger in Kalihi, a large space that allowed to make the Smoke Monster ""flip him around in weird physical positions"".[4] A stunt double was dragged through cables, and along with the digital monster and wire removal, fast editing made the scene akin to ""a magician's trick"", in Blank's opinion.[4] The episode was written by Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker, who had previously worked in another series by Lost production company Bad Robot Productions, Alias.[5] Cuse and Lindelof stated that Nikki and Paulo served as a red herring as rumors were raised of an incoming character death, and the fanbase would expect this to happen to the newcomers ""who were sort of just there all along"" instead of a prominent and popular character as Eko.[2] Juliet's message to Jack is an homage to Bob Dylan's video for ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"", where the musician flips cue cards while looking at the camera.[2] This episode attracted 16.07 million American viewers in its original broadcast on November 1, 2006, standing as the tenth most watched program of the week.[6] In the United Kingdom, the episode had 1.247 million viewers, ranking third in multichannel shows after Ford Super Sunday and The Simpsons.[7] In Canada, ""The Cost of Living"" had 1.15 million viewers, ranking as the 26th highest-rated program of the week.[8] Reviews were positive, though most critics found that the character of Eko was killed too soon in the show. Writing for Zap2it, Rick Porter said that while ""The Cost of Living"" was the best episode of season 3 thus far with ""an illuminating flashback, some heavy island juju and a nice mix of the campers and the Others"", the death of Eko removed from Lost ""one of its most compelling characters and best actors, which just flat-out sucks.""[9]Kristin dos Santos of E! Online called Mr. Eko ""the best character of the show"", and was therefore very disappointed with his death.[10] Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly stated that she would miss Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and found Juliet's message to be the best part of the episode, that like the rest of season three ""answered a few questions (whose tumor?), raised a few questions (who's the eye-patch guy?), and ignored many long-standing questions (how did Yemi and Eko crash on the same island?).""[11] IGN's Chris Carabott ranked the episode 9.3 out of 10, saying it was ""one of the series' best efforts"" exploring the series' mythology and providing new paths, while also featuring Eko in ""one of the most refreshing flashbacks that the series has produced thus far"" and ""a shocking confrontation"" with the Smoke Monster. The reviewer still complained about Nikki and Paulo's participation, considering them ""poorly developed"" and giving ""the sense that they are being shoehorned in"".[12] The website later ranked ""The Cost of Living"" as the 25th best episode of the series, saying that while early Season 3 ""might have dragged a bit"", ""The Cost of Living"" ""saw the excitement and drama ramp up considerably. The only thing marring this otherwise excellent episode was the presence of Nikki and Paolo.""[13] On the other hand, a similar list by the Los Angeles Times ranked it 96th, considering that despite being ""actually a pretty good piece of TV"", the episode was ""just marred by the fact that the show was forced into killing Mr. Eko, a character whose story was far from over.""[14]",4538,8.2
I Do,3,6,Tucker Gates,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,Kate,2006-11-08,17.150000000000002,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Do_(Lost),"""I Do"" is the sixth episode of the third season of Lost, and the 55th episode overall. It aired on November 8, 2006, on ABC. The episode was written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by Tucker Gates. The character of Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is featured in the episode's flashbacks, where her brief marriage to a police officer, Kevin Callis (Nathan Fillion), is shown. In the present events, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) considers whether or not to perform surgery on Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), and is motivated by Kate's claims that if he does not comply, Sawyer (Josh Holloway) will be killed. This was the last episode to air before a 13-week hiatus, so it was written so that it would fit as a ""mini-series finale"", and also had a major theme in the contrast between Kate's relationships with Kevin and Sawyer. ""I Do"" gained mostly positive reviews, with much praise for the cliffhanger ending, and had 17.15 million American viewers upon release. While on the run from the law, Kate goes to Miami, where under the name ""Monica"" she meets and marries a police officer, Kevin Callis (Nathan Fillion), even getting from his mother, Suzanne, a gold locket that had been passed down on the female side of the family (Suzanne never had any daughters). A while after the ceremony, Kate calls U.S. Marshal Edward Mars (Fredric Lane), saying she does not want to run anymore and pleads for him to stop chasing her. Mars guesses that Kate has gotten involved with a man, and tells her that if Kate can really settle down, he will stop chasing her, but that they both know it is unlikely that Kate will ever stop running. Later, Kate shows signs of relief after getting a negative pregnancy test, and decides to reveal the truth about her life to her husband. She drugs Kevin, places her mother-in-law's locket in his hands, and leaves. In the jungle, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) tells Nikki Fernandez (Kiele Sanchez), Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro), Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) that Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) was killed by an animal, and decides to bury Eko where he died, thinking the other castaways have seen ""too many funerals"" recently. As Locke leaves to get shovels as well as Eko's stick (he believes it'd be inappropriate to bury him without it), Sayid follows him and asks what really killed Eko. Locke says that the survivors call it ""The Monster"", and further speculates that The Monster may be what brought them there and that Eko died for a reason, he just does not know what it is yet. During the burial, Locke sees a message on Eko's stick: ""Lift up your eyes and look north, John 3:05"". On Hydra Island, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) says that Ben Linus's (Michael Emerson) tumor will become inoperable in a week, but adds he is not going to operate on Ben because he does not trust the Others' promise of freeing him, Kate and Sawyer (Josh Holloway). Trying to convince him otherwise, Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) brings Kate to talk to Jack, telling her that it is the only way to prevent Danny Pickett (Michael Bowen) from killing Sawyer. When Kate tells him this, Jack gets angry and refuses. After Kate returns to her cage, she has an argument with Sawyer, climbs out of her cage, and breaks open Sawyer's, saying if he does not want Jack to save his life, he is going to save his own. Sawyer then tells her that they cannot run because they are on another island, something he did not tell her ""because I wanted you to believe that we had a damn chance."" Kate and Sawyer then have sex, unknowingly in full view of the cameras. At the Hydra station, Jack finds his door unlocked and unguarded, and outside reaches a surveillance room, where he sees Kate and Sawyer cuddling together on a monitor. Ben appears behind him, and after a brief exchange Jack decides to do the surgery, but wants Ben to keep his promise to let Jack off the island. Ben agrees when he says ""done"". As Jack begins the operation, Pickett goes with another man to Sawyer's cage, ready to execute Sawyer as he holds Sawyer's group of survivors responsible for his wife Colleen's death (Colleen was shot by Sun earlier). Sawyer surrenders once Kate is held at gunpoint, but before Pickett can shoot Sawyer, he gets a call from Tom (M.C. Gainey). Jack has sabotaged the operation by cutting Ben's kidney sack; Jack states that if he does not sew up his incision within an hour, Ben will die. Holding Ben hostage, Jack demands to speak with Kate. Pickett holds off on executing Sawyer and gives Kate the walkie-talkie; Jack tells her to run, directing her to call him on the radio when she is safe, but Kate doesn't want to leave without him. ""It's actually more difficult for her to stay in that house and cook breakfast and be a little housewife, than it is for her to break rocks and work in a quarry and sleep in a cage."" —Evangeline Lilly[2] Show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse wrote ""I Do"" as a ""mini-season finale"", as it was the last episode before mid-season hiatus, and would end in a cliffhanger. It also served as a climax and beginning of a closure of Jack, Kate, and Sawyer's captivity on Hydra Island,[2] with the writers saying that afterwards there would be a return to the beach and the six-episode block would be ""more palatable"" and make more sense, comparing them to the first seven episodes of season 2 where the tail section survivors are introduced.[3] Executive producer Bryan Burk also said the pre-hiatus episodes were ""our season 2.5. Like, this is kind of like wrapping up a lot of where we were last year"", considering season three would really begin in the seventh episode.[4] A main theme of the episode is Kate's inability to commit to other people, always running from difficult emotional situations, and having barriers between her and her interests – physical, as in Sawyer's cage or Jack's aquarium, or metaphorical, as in her inability to settle down as Kevin's wife. Kate's marriage, which was first alluded to in the season one episode ""Outlaws"", is meant to be a contrast with her relationship with Sawyer in the realtime events – Kate and Kevin is a heartfelt and passionate relationship where Kate tries to get involved but her lifestyle ends up on making the marriage fail, whereas with Sawyer both are afraid of intimacy and connection yet still end up together.[2] Nathan Fillion was cast as Kevin because the producers thought he fit as ""someone to believe that Kate had actually married and settled down with"" for being ""really good and kinda fun and intelligent"", and also because Cuse and Lindelof were fans of Fillion's work on Firefly.[3] Fillion said that he was a Lost fan and described his experience working at the show as ""a dream"".[5] 17.15 million American viewers watched this episode live, standing as the ninth most-seen program of the week.[6] It also had 1.1 million viewers in the United Kingdom.[7] Chris Carabott of IGN gave a 9.3 out of 10 to ""I Do"". He felt it left ended with a great cliffhanger.[8] Carabott complimented Locke's scenes as ""short but nonetheless powerful"" and praised Matthew Fox's acting, saying he ""steals the show with one of his best performances to date"".[8] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Christine Fenno thought that the flashbacks were ""full of fun details"", although the events on the island were more exciting.[9] Jonathan Toomey of AOL's TV Squad and BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl thought it was a worthy mid-season finale. Toomey liked the romantic scenes between Kate and Sawyer created great tension[10] and Dahl had a good reaction to the cliffhanger which ""set up incredible possibilities for the rest of the season"".[11] Not all reviews were positive, with Slant Magazine's critic Andrew Dignan feeling it was ""lacking both the immediacy and urgency that keeps viewers clamoring for months on end"", and being critical of the writing, particularly on most of the essential plot elements occurring in the final minutes.[12] ""I Do"" was selected as one of the ""25 Sexiest TV Shows on DVD"" by Entertainment Weekly.[13] IGN ranked the episode 28th out of the 115 Lost episodes, describing it as a ""turning point episode of the third season.""[14] On the other hand, a similar list by Los Angeles Times ranked ""I Do"" as the 91st, saying it ""mostly botched"" the plot point of Kate's wedding despite Nathan Fillion's presence, and feeling it was an episode that ""probably shouldn't have had to have as much pressure on it as it did (acting as a mini-cliffhanger in early Season 3)"".[15] Evangeline Lilly submitted this episode for consideration for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.[16]",4797,8.6
Not in Portland,3,7,Stephen Williams,Carlton Cuse & Jeff Pinkner,Juliet,2007-02-07,14.49,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_in_Portland,"""Not in Portland"" is the 7th episode of the third season of Lost and the 56th episode overall. It first aired on February 7, 2007, on ABC. The episode was written by Carlton Cuse and Jeff Pinkner and was directed by Stephen Williams. The character of Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) is featured in the episode’s flashbacks. In Miami, Florida, fertility doctor Juliet Burke cares for her ill sister, Rachel Carlson (Robin Weigert), in a hospital where Ethan Rom (William Mapother) works. Juliet is currently injecting Rachel with a drug that would revert her sterility caused by chemotherapy. While Juliet is sneaking into the research laboratory where she works to steal more of the drug, she is discovered by her boss and ex-husband Edmund Burke (Željko Ivanek), who the next day confronts Juliet regarding the research she has been conducting on her sister, asking to be involved in the project. Juliet, however, does not give him an answer. Juliet is then interviewed by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) from a biomedical research company called Mittelos Bioscience, asking her to join their office in Portland, Oregon. However, Juliet begins to cry, stating that Edmund would never let her go and short of ""getting hit by a bus"", she was bound to him. Apologizing, Juliet leaves, adding that she is no leader. When Juliet comes home, Rachel is there, telling that the treatment worked and she is pregnant. Juliet then speaks to her ex-husband and tells him about her sister's pregnancy. Edmund is happy and wants all her data but Juliet is adamant against publishing. Edmund is upset when he steps out in the road and is immediately hit by a bus. At the morgue to identify Edmund's body and sign the paperwork, Juliet cries and Ethan appears, handing her some tissues. Alpert introduces him as his colleague. Juliet thinks aloud about her comment to Alpert regarding Edmund getting hit by a bus, but Alpert says he does not recall, and that Juliet cannot blame herself for that ""tragic accident."" He knows about Rachel's pregnancy because of their ""very thorough recruitment process"" and asks once more for Juliet to join their research, just for six months. Juliet asks whether she can bring her sister, but Alpert admits it may be difficult for her to get her treatment at such a remote facility, as it is in fact ""not quite in Portland."" Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) holds Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) hostage in the operating room as Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) escape. Juliet reveals to him that they cannot escape, as the Hydra facility is on a separate island. Angry, Jack reveals to Tom (M.C. Gainey) that Juliet had previously asked him to kill Ben during surgery, making Tom ask Juliet to leave the room. Meanwhile, Kate and Sawyer go into the jungle to escape the Others. Alex Rousseau (Tania Raymonde) helps them temporarily hide from their pursuers, and then reveals that she has a boat Kate and Sawyer may use to escape to the main island. In return, she asks them to help her rescue her boyfriend, Karl (Blake Bashoff). The three get him from a facility where Karl appears to be undergoing Ludovico technique brainwashing. Ben awakens from the anesthesia, having overheard Jack's discussion with Tom, and demands to speak to Juliet in private. After talking to Ben, she instructs Jack to finish the surgery and she will help his friends escape. While Jack finishes Ben's operation with the help of Tom, Juliet kills Danny Pickett (Michael Bowen) as he finds the fugitives on the beach and is about to shoot Sawyer. Juliet then tells Alex that she must remain as Karl, Kate and Sawyer start rowing away from Hydra Island. Later Juliet talks to Jack in the Hydra, saying that Jack will return to his cell until they figure out what to do with him. When Jack asks what Ben told her to make Juliet want to save his life, she replies that after more than three years on the island, Juliet would be allowed to leave the island and go home if she let Ben live and helped Jack's friends escape. This was the first episode to air after a thirteen-week hiatus. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Mr. Eko) is no longer credited with the starring cast. Nestor Carbonell was originally contracted to guest star in ""Not in Portland"", with the possibility of the role becoming recurring.[2] After the producers enjoyed his performance,[3] his contract was extended to five further appearances in season three.[2]Rob McElhenney made a guest appearance as ""Aldo"" because he was friends with Damon Lindelof who was also a fan of the sitcom It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia which McElhenney created and stars in. 14.49 million American viewers tuned into this episode.[4]IGN's Chris Carabott wrote that ""if 'Not in Portland' didn't get you back on the Lost hype train then for goodness' sake the equally outstanding 'Flashes Before Your Eyes' hopefully grabbed your attention.""[5]",4783,8.7
Flashes Before Your Eyes,3,8,Jack Bender,Damon Lindelof & Drew Goddard,Desmond,2007-02-14,12.84,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashes_Before_Your_Eyes,"""Flashes Before Your Eyes"" is the 8th episode of the third season of the American drama television series Lost, and the show's 57th episode overall. The episode was written by the series co-creator, show runner and executive producer Damon Lindelof and supervising producer Drew Goddard, and directed by Jack Bender. It first aired in the United States on February 14, 2007, on the American Broadcasting Company. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. Lindelof and Goddard were nominated for the Writers Guild of America (WGA) Award for Best Episodic Drama at the February 2008 ceremony for writing the episode.[2] In this episode, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) conclude that Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) can see into the future after he saves Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) from drowning. It is revealed that after the hatch imploded, Desmond traveled back to London and relived his past before coming back to the island. Desmond also reveals to Charlie that the latter is destined to die. While in the middle of a conversation with several other castaways, Desmond, without warning, sprints toward and dives into the ocean. No one on the beach understands why, until they see that Claire is drowning in the ocean but Desmond saves her. Noting this event, as well as events that have happened previously in the season – such as Desmond knowing about a speech Locke would make before he would make it, as well as Desmond inserting a rod on a tent just hours before that rod was struck by lightning – Hurley concludes that Desmond has precognition, but Charlie is skeptical. They hatch a plan to get Desmond to get drunk and confess. After several drinks, Charlie asks Desmond about his future-seeing abilities. Instead of answering, Desmond gets up to leave, but after Charlie calls him a ""coward"", a drunken Desmond tackles and chokes Charlie, shouting that Charlie does not know what he has been through. We are then shown a flashback scene to the hatch about to implode following the failure to enter the numbers in ""Live Together, Die Alone"". After Desmond twists the key, he suddenly wakes up in a London apartment with his girlfriend Penelope Widmore (Sonya Walger), and he is shown to have vague memories of his time on the island. Desmond is clearly puzzled, but is relieved to finally be with Penny again. Desmond later goes to Penny's billionaire father, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) and asks for his permission to marry his daughter. Widmore rejects Desmond, who is crushed and humiliated. Walking out of the building, Desmond sees Charlie singing and playing his guitar for money on the sidewalk. Desmond asks him if he remembers him but Charlie does not. Frustrated, Desmond rants about his time on the island and predicts it will rain, which it suddenly does. At a pub, Desmond meets with his friend, a physicist, and after retelling the events on the island asks him if time travel is possible, but the physicist denies it. Hearing familiar music, Desmond predicts for several events to happen in this pub tonight, namely the outcome of a soccer game being broadcast on TV as well as a thug about to attack the bartender, but neither event happens. Later, while shopping for a ring for Penny, Desmond runs into the shopkeeper, Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan). She tells Desmond his future. Hawking takes Desmond on a walk, and Hawking notes a particular man, with red shoes, just before he is crushed to death by a falling scaffolding. She explains that although she knew the man would die, she did not help because the universe has a way of ""course correcting"", and he would die anyway; if she warned him of the scaffolding, he would be hit by a taxi the next day, if she warned him of that he'd break his neck in a shower accident the next. Desmond and Penny go on a walk together and take a picture, where he breaks up with her after realizing that he does not have enough money to support her. He returns to the pub, and the predictions he made the previous night turn out to be true – this shows that Desmond does have precognition, his timing was just off. Desmond warns the bartender of the thug attacking him, and he ducks, but the thug's bat hits Desmond and he is knocked out. He wakes up back on the Island naked, as seen in ""Further Instructions"". The flashback ends, and Desmond is pulled off Charlie by Hurley. They help Desmond to his tent. Charlie tries to get an answer from him one last time. Desmond reveals that both times he rescued Claire, he was really saving Charlie; Charlie would have been electrocuted if Desmond hadn't inserted the rod, and Charlie would have drowned attempting to save Claire from the ocean had Desmond not done so. Desmond tells Charlie that although he has prevented his death twice, Charlie is destined to die (this is in reference to Hawking's comments on ""course correction""). ""Flashes Before Your Eyes"" was the 15th episode of the series directed by Jack Bender. The episode was written by Damon Lindelof and Drew Goddard; the pair had never before collaborated on an episode. This episode is the first to deal with the concept of time travel, the next being ""The Constant"" in the fourth season. Unlike other flashback sequences to this point, this is positioned as actual time travel for Desmond. However, in this episode ground rules are established to prevent paradoxes in the story line as a result of time travel. Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened.[3] In an interview, Henry Ian Cusick, who plays Desmond, said shooting the episode was both ""fun"" and ""tiring"". Cusick said that when shooting the episode ""you're finishing late and starting early"", but he enjoyed working with director Jack Bender because ""he pushes you to, to try and go a little bit further than you think you can"". The London scenes were shot in Honolulu. This led to several continuity errors, such as a British Army recruitment poster for a Scottish regiment (which would not recruit in England) featuring the word ""Honour"" being incorrectly spelled in the American English ""Honor"" and a photograph of a British soldier using an American M4 carbine and urging people to join the ""military"" (instead of the ""army"", as a British poster would say). ""Flashes Before Your Eyes"" received mostly positive reviews. IGN's Chris Carabott wrote that ""if last week's 'Not in Portland' didn't get you back on the Lost hype train then for goodness' sake the equally outstanding 'Flashes Before Your Eyes' hopefully grabbed your attention."" Carabott went on to praise the on-screen chemistry of Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond) and Sonya Walger (Penelope), stating that ""their on screen chemistry makes the love between the two characters real and makes their inevitable breakup that much harder to handle."" He also complimented the scene between Desmond and Charles, saying that ""it's hard not to feel Desmond's heart crushed when Widmore denies him Penelope's hand in marriage.""[4] Josh Spiegel, a writer for CinemaBlend.com, had similar praise. He said that for him ""it was a nice change of pace to not see Jack, Kate or Sawyer on the show and focus more on some of the lesser-known castaways."" Spiegel went on to say that the episode was ""fantastic"".[5] Mania.com's Stephen Lackey wrote that ""Flashes Before Your Eyes"" was an ""episode has everything die hard LOST fans expect, riveting plot twists, foreshadowing, and as many questions as answers""[6] Critics did note that the episode did not provide many answers.[4][7] Mac Slocum of FilmFodder.com wrote that he was ""beginning to think the Lost producers have a different definition for the word 'answer'.""[7]Television Without Pity graded this episode with a ""C"".[8] Henry Ian Cusick and Dominic Monaghan each submitted this episode for consideration on their own behalf for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series respectively for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.[9] For their work on this episode, series co-creator, show runner, and executive producer Damon Lindelof and supervising producer Drew Goddard were nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Drama.[2]",5883,9.1
Stranger in a Strange Land,3,9,Paris Barclay,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Christina M. Kim,Jack,2007-02-21,12.950000000000001,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land_(Lost),"""Stranger in a Strange Land"" is the ninth episode of the third season of the American drama television series Lost, and the show's 58th episode overall. The episode was written by Elizabeth Sarnoff and Christina M. Kim, and directed by Paris Barclay. It first aired in the United States on February 21, 2007, on ABC. In the episode, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Karl (Blake Bashoff), and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) continue to journey back to the beach camp, while Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Alex (Tania Raymonde) must save Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) from execution. Flashbacks reveal the origin of Jack's tattoos. In flashbacks, Jack is in Phuket, Thailand, where he meets a local woman named Achara (Bai Ling); the two soon enter into a relationship. After finding out that she works in a tattoo parlor and claims to be able to see who people really are, Jack demands that she give him a tattoo. Achara is hesitant to give him a tattoo, but she does so anyway and tells him there will be consequences. The next morning, he is beaten up by her brother and other locals and told to leave. Sawyer and Kate begin the episode on Alex's canoe with an unconscious Karl, paddling away from the Hydra island. Kate suggests returning for Jack; however, Sawyer refuses. Kate and Sawyer land on the main island and question Karl about the Others. Karl reveals that the Others work on the Hydra island, but live on the main island. The next morning, Sawyer finds Karl crying in the jungle. Karl says that he is crying because he misses Alex. Sawyer asks Karl if he is in love, which Karl affirms to be true. Sawyer tells him that love is worth the risks of getting caught by the Others and lets Karl go into the jungle to find Alex. Jack is put into the bear cage, and notices a handcuffed Juliet being led to his old prison. She visits him later and asks Jack to treat Ben's back, which has become infected following the surgery, but Jack refuses. She also explains that she is in trouble with the Others for killing Pickett. Later, Isabel (Diana Scarwid), the Others' ""sheriff,"" arrives at the cage and discusses Jack's tattoo with him, as she can read the Chinese. Isabel brings him to a room where Juliet is being held and asks him whether Juliet told him to kill Ben or not. Jack lies and says she did not and is brought back to his cage. Once back, he is visited by Cindy Chandler (Kimberley Joseph) and the previously kidnapped members of the tail-section. Cindy starts to ask Jack questions, saying they are here to ""watch"", but he angrily sends her away. Alex visits Jack later and tells him that the Others are planning to execute Juliet. Alex helps him escape from his cage, and they go to Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), who writes a note, sparing Juliet, in return for Jack's continuing to be Ben's doctor. The two then go to a trial the Others are holding for Juliet, and Alex gives Isabel Ben's note, which says Juliet is not to be executed, but is to be marked instead (with a branded symbol at the base of her spine). When Juliet later asks Jack why he helped her, he replies that it is because Ben said he would let both of them off the island and he wants to make that happen by working together. At the end of the episode, Jack and the Others travel back to the main island on a boat. Just before leaving, Isabel translates Jack's tattoo, ""He walks amongst us, but he is not one of us"". Jack replies, ""That's what they say, that's not what they mean."" ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" was the first episode of the series directed by Paris Barclay. Barclay had previously won two Emmy Awards for directing episodes of NYPD Blue.[2] The episode was written by Elizabeth Sarnoff and Christina M. Kim, the pair had previously worked together on the second season episodes ""The Hunting Party"", ""The Whole Truth"", and ""Two for the Road"". Although Jack had tattoos on his arm the entire series, their origin had never been explained. Matthew Fox received the tattoos before Lost was even created. The producers considered putting make-up over them, but instead, decided just to keep them and fit it in with the plot.[3] According to Assistant Professor Xinping Zhu of Northeastern University, the tattoo is made up of four Chinese characters from a poem written by Mao Zedong in 1925. Fox's tattoo translates to ""Eagles high up, cleaving the space"".[4] (In this episode however, one of ""the Others"" tells Jack that his tattoo translates as: ""He walks among us, but he is not one of us."" Jack replies, ""That's what they say, that's not what they mean."")[5] The number 5 can also be seen on Fox's forearm; he got that tattoo while working on Party of Five, along with another cast member.[6] In an interview, Fox said that for him, getting a tattoo was a ""pretty intense experience"", and something he would not do in the ""spur of the moment"". He thought Jack having tattoos was a ""really cool idea"".[7] Since Fox used tattoos to represent memories or meaningful events in his life, the writers took a similar approach when dealing with Jack's tattoos.[8] ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" was shot in various places on the island of Oahu. The scenes with Kate, Sawyer, and Karl on the canoe were shot in Kāne'ohe Bay, while the flashback beach scenes were filmed on Waimanalo Beach. The shots of Jack in a cage were done in Oahu's Paradise Park. The Others' tank and operating room are located in a film studio on the island.[9]Bai Ling, who played Achara, recalled that when shooting the sex scene between her character and Jack, she was ""kind of nervous"" because she did not know Fox very well. Ling recalls that ""we (she and Fox) both had a mutual understanding to just go for it. Sometimes I'm on top of him, sometimes he's on top of me.""[10] ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" was watched by 12.95 million Americans, ranking Lost as the 21st most watched program of the week.[11] This was an increase in viewers from the previous episode, making Lost the number one scripted television series in the adults 18-49 category for the third consecutive week. The episode garnered more viewers than other television series' showing at the same time on other networks, including Criminal Minds and CSI: NY.[12] The ratings, however, were a decrease compared to the same time the previous year, when the episode ""One of Them"" garnered 18.20 million Americans.[13] ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" garnered many negative reviews from critics. Chris Carabott, a writer for IGN, wrote that ""the episode was ""nothing more than a transition episode"". Carabott felt that although it was ""a necessary evil in episodic television like Lost"", it did not ""excuse the poor execution and uninteresting story"".[14] IGN later chose it as the worst episode of the series, describing it as ""pointless and boring"".[15] Cinemablend.com's Josh Spiegel claimed that the episode ""was the first rough patch of an otherwise very good third season."" Spiegel went on to write that although previews for ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" promised that three questions would be answered, they were not the mysteries he had been worried about.[16] Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com was upset about the ""overblown marketing"" which failed to deliver the answers that he wanted.[17] ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" is widely considered amongst Lost fans as the worst episode of the series, and was even recognized as such by show runner Damon Lindelof in an interview.[18] It was part of the inspiration to set an end date for the series.[19]",4719,7.2
Tricia Tanaka Is Dead,3,10,Eric Laneuville,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Hurley,2007-02-28,12.78,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricia_Tanaka_Is_Dead,"""Tricia Tanaka Is Dead"" is the tenth episode of the third season of the American drama television series Lost, and the show's 59th episode overall. The episode was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by Eric Laneuville. It first aired on ABC in the United States on February 28, 2007. The character of Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) is featured in the episode's flashbacks, as he reminisces over his father (guest star Cheech Marin) abandoning his family for seventeen years. On the island, Hurley works with Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) to repair an old Volkswagen camper van while Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) ponders what to do about the still-captured Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). ""Tricia Tanaka Is Dead"" was seen by an estimated 12.78 million viewers. In interviews, Garcia, Dae Kim, and Holloway commented that they had fun shooting their scenes, as they had not worked together for a while. The episode marked the first appearance of recurring guest actor Cheech Marin. The episode received polarized reviews; many praised its humor and focus on Hurley while others emphasized that little was learned concerning the show's overall mythology. Young Hurley (Caden Waidyatilleka) joins his father, David Reyes (Cheech Marin), over an old Camaro that they want to repair. It won't start however, and David assures him good things happen when you believe they will, and that in this world you have to ""make your own luck."" While leaving for Las Vegas, David gives Hurley a chocolate bar and promises to return soon. Notably, young Hurley is not overweight at all in this scene, and he comments that his mother doesn't approve of him eating sweets, implying that this was the event that caused Hurley to become overweight. Now an adult, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) watches as his new Mr. Cluck's chicken restaurant gets hit by a meteorite, killing those inside, including Tricia Tanaka (Sung-Hi Lee), the newswoman who just interviewed him about his lottery winnings. Hurley arrives home, telling his mother his intent to go to Australia to end the bad luck curse he believes was bestowed upon him after he won the lottery. She tries to disprove the curse by revealing his father has returned to them after seventeen years. Suspecting his father of only wanting the lottery money, Hurley reacts angrily. David brings his son to a tarot card reader (Suzanne Krull), who tells Hurley she can 'remove' the curse before admitting that David paid her to say this. Hurley vows to give the money away, and begins packing for Australia. David acknowledges he just returned for the money, but approves of Hurley's decision and promises he will be waiting for him when Hurley gets back. On the island, Hurley sorrowfully speaks to Libby's grave about what happened to Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) after they were taken by the Others. Hurley learns that Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) believes that Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) sees visions of Charlie's death. Hurley believes this and tells Charlie that he thinks he brings bad luck. Vincent the dog shows up with a mummified human arm, leading Hurley to a Volkswagen camper van on its side underneath the foliage. Inside is a skeleton wearing a DHARMA Initiative jumpsuit sporting the name ""Roger"" on its chest and the Swan station's logo. On the beach, Hurley's requests for help are turned down. Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), who doesn't understand what Hurley is saying, is roped into helping. Hurley finds beer in the van and a returned Sawyer outside. He learns from Sawyer that he and Kate escaped but Jack is still prisoner. Hurley is very optimistic about the future and volunteers Sawyer to help him fix the van. Meanwhile, Desmond refuses to tell Charlie when he will die. Kate informs Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) of all she knows about the Others and then leaves, saying she's going to get help to rescue Jack, but she won't say from whom. Hurley, Jin and Sawyer raid the van and find maps and beer. Meanwhile, Hurley tells Charlie to stop moping and help him start the car, saying that he might die doing it but they should make their own luck, face death, and possibly win. Hurley eventually convinces the others to push the van to a slope in order to get it started. Despite Sawyer's warnings, Hurley goes through with the plan. Charlie declares ""victory or death"" and rides with Hurley, as Sawyer and Jin push the vehicle down the steep hill. At first it looks as though they will crash, but the van starts just in time. Later, the entire group enjoys a ride. Hurley is later left with the van and continues driving. Jin gives Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) a flower, Charlie talks with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) and Sawyer brings some beer for Kate but finds that she isn't around. Meanwhile, Kate meets up with John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and Sayid on her way to find Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), from whom she hopes to get help. Locke reveals he has compass readings from Mr. Eko's stick. Kate's recruiting of Rousseau seems to fail until she mentions her suspicions about Alex, who helped Kate escape, being Rousseau's daughter. Having worked with executive producer Carlton Cuse on Nash Bridges,[2] guest actor Cheech Marin was called by Cuse requesting he appear on Lost, to which Marin responded ""You know, that sounds like a lot of fun... It's in Hawaii, right? I can do that!'""[3] Cuse later commented, ""He's quite a good actor. People only think of him as the doobie-smoking '70s dude. But he played Tyne Daly's love interest in Judging Amy. C'mon!""[2] While shooting the episode, Jorge Garcia noted ""the group on the beach has been quite big. They laid out the most cast chairs I've ever seen at one time since the pilot and it's been fun.""[4] Garcia previewed his character's flashback in a New York Post interview, ""[it is] the kind of relationship Hurley has with his father and how it's changed from when he was a kid now that he's an adult and a lottery winner. He finds something on the island that brings him back to that time and that's how it all gets started"".[4] Actor Josh Holloway was told that an emotional undercurrent of the episode concerned his failed relationship with Kate. Holloway commented that Sawyer is thinking I have ""my beer... but I don't have my girl. He's worried, and drowning it with beer"".[5] To help train the dog playing Vincent for the episode's needed scenes, Madison was given the fake arm to take home and play with; when finally brought on the set, the crew had difficulty shooting her because Madison would bring and drop off the arm slightly differently each time, causing trouble recreating the same camera angles.[5] Actor Daniel Dae Kim described their scenes with the beer in the DVD special features, ""The comedic scenes with Josh were so much fun to play because it was a lighter side. A nice change of pace.""[6] Like their characters, the actors had not been in scenes together in a while, so Dae Kim thought it ""was fun to catch up and have fun in the process"".[5][7] The episode featured Hurley driving a bus down a hill. To create this scene, Garcia had to drive the bus down a small hill ""very stead[ily]"" to ensure the cameraman could record it all; towards the end however, they told Garcia to just ""go for it"", allowing him to ""cut loose a little"".[6] For the close-up shots of Garcia and Dominic Monaghan, the production crew would shake the bus to simulate driving, and brush various pieces of foliage across the windshield to make it seem the bus was hitting bushes or trees. A stunt double standing in for Garcia performed the largest hill in the drive down; they were unable to rehearse due to getting rained out, so their first rehearsal was done on film. Dae Kim commented that ""it was just great to have as much fun on camera as we do off camera"",[6] and that there was no real acting that day, as they were all enjoying themselves as much as their characters.[5] The Volkswagen campus van — still in operating condition — along with Hurley's Camaro, were later auctioned off with other Lost props and costumes at the Santa Monica Airport in 2010.[8] The song ""Shambala"" by Three Dog Night is used several times in the episode, both in Hurley's flashbacks and on the Island.[9] On its original American broadcast on February 28, 2007, an estimated 12.78 million viewers tuned into the episode, making it the 24th most watched television program of the week.[10] After what he felt was a period of bad episodes culminating with ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine praised ""Tricia Tanaka Is Dead"" as a ""palate cleanser, reminding us that this show is meant to be, above all else, fun"". He described the episode as an ""expected pleasure, disarming in a way [Lost] hasn't been since Season One, back before these people became jaded by ""Others"" and consumed with tedious busy work while the show's producers figured out what frequently disappointing direction to push them in next.""[11] Dignan did however acknowledge that others might not have found the episode as enjoyable as he did.[11] Erin Martell of TV Squad wasn't sure what to think of the episode, believing that it was ""entertaining"" but produced nothing new for viewers. She did note that the characters are now in place to take action for following episodes, and hoped that the episode's ""slow-moving events"" were ""building up to some serious resolution"".[12] Rather than dismiss the episode for lacking a mythology-related storyline, Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called it ""a joyous and poignant hour of television"", and said that it ""could very well be a cleverly crafted allegory for the history of The Dharma Initiative on The Island.""[13]Alan Sepinwall called it the third season's best aired episode yet ""by quite a stretch"" for adding needed humor to the series and focusing on more of the cast and Hurley. He stated that ""[b]y the episode's climax, I really cared about whether they could get that damn Microbus to start, even if it would only be useful for going around in circles.""[14] New York Magazine put ""Tricia Tanaka Is Dead"" as third of its list of ""Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes"", claiming that ""because with all his other problems, daddy issues don't feel like something that needs to be thrown at Hurley"" and David could have been written as a positive character ""just to add some variation to the bad-dad overkill on this show"".[15]IGN ranked ""Tricia Tanaka Is Dead"" as the second worst Lost episode, above only ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", explaining ""Is there a better metaphor that Lost was running in circles at this point in Season 3 than seeing several of the castaways driving in circles on the island, with goofy grins on their faces?... With a dull story on the island and flashbacks weakly giving Hurley the requisite daddy issues so many of the other characters already had, it was clear Lost needed to make a big change soon to recapture what was special about the show. Thankfully, they did.""[16] A similar list by the Los Angeles Times ranked the episode much higher at 31, writing ""The haters need to shut up. This is a nearly pure embrace of the Lost ethos. You make your own fate up until the moment when you don't.""[17] Various reviewers praised Jorge Garcia's performance,[18] with one believing the episode ""was a reminder that Garcia's not only a wonderful (and much needed) comedic outlet for the show but a fine actor who specializes in intimate dramas of anxiety and self-realization"".[11] Garcia submitted this episode for consideration for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.[19]",4836,8.3
Enter 77,3,11,Stephen Williams,Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof,Sayid,2007-03-07,12.450000000000001,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_77,"""Enter 77"" is the 11th episode of the third season of Lost, and the 60th episode overall. It was aired on March 7, 2007. The episode was written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by Stephen Williams. The character of Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. In his flashback, Sayid is a chef in a restaurant in Paris. He is summoned onto the portico by an Iraqi named Sami (Shaun Toub), who compliments the meal Sayid cooked for him, and offers him a job as a chef in his new restaurant. Sayid later arrives at the restaurant, and meets Sami's wife, Amira (Anne Bedian). She has burn scars on her arm, but their introduction is cut short when the woman confirms that Sayid is ""him"". Sayid is suddenly attacked and knocked unconscious. He is chained up in the basement of the restaurant. Sami explains that his wife was tortured by the Republican Guard, and she recognized her torturer to be Sayid. Sayid denies this passionately. Sami's wife is brought before Sayid as Sami begins to brutally beat him, trying to get him to admit that he tortured his wife. Sami reaches for an iron bar, but his wife stops him. The following day, Sayid is visited by Amira. She explains that she rescued a cat from torture by street kids (which bears a striking resemblance to the cat at the Flame station), and while it sleeps with her and loves her, it also sometimes attacks her, because it sometimes forgets that it is safe. She forgives him for this, because she also knows what it is like to never be safe, because of Sayid. Sayid admits that he remembers her, that her face has haunted him since he left Iraq. He breaks down in tears and emotionally apologizes, over and over. Amira forgives him. Moreover, she says she will tell Sami that she has made a terrible mistake, that they have found the wrong person, so that Sami will let him go. In the jungle, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Sayid, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) stumble across a farmhouse with a satellite dish on its roof. Its inhabitant (Andrew Divoff) is revealed to be the mysterious one-eyed man whom Sayid, Locke and company saw on The Pearl's monitoring video in an earlier episode. Rousseau decides not to get involved, so she leaves as the rest of the group proceeds to the farmhouse. Sayid approaches unarmed (noticing a mysterious cat whose name is later revealed to be Nadia after Nadia Comăneci), but as he nears, the one-eyed man appears with a Mosin–Nagant rifle in his hands. He shoots Sayid in the shoulder, screaming that he didn't cross the line, and that they had a truce. After Sayid tells him about the plane crash, the one-eyed man emerges. Kate and Locke rush out from hiding to disarm him. The one-eyed man reveals his name to be Mikhail Bakunin (the same first and last name as the famous Russian anarchist), and claims that he is the last living member of the DHARMA Initiative. While treating Sayid's gunshot wound, Mikhail tells the survivors about how he came to the island, after responding to a newspaper advertisement for the DHARMA Initiative. He has been on the island for eleven years, staying in the station called The Flame, where he communicates with the outside world. Mikhail tells Sayid that several years ago, the DHARMA Initiative launched a purge against ""the hostiles,"" but Mikhail did not participate in it. As a result, the hostiles let him live, provided he did not cross the line around his house. He also states that the dish on the roof has not worked for years, and that the hostiles were on the island long before the DHARMA Initiative. Meanwhile, Locke finds a computer running a chess program. He plays and begins a losing streak. Sayid realizes Mikhail is an Other, not a member of the DHARMA Initiative, and almost certainly is not alone. Mikhail explains that the station is connected to an underwater beacon to guide submarines to the island. When Sayid taunts Mikhail about killing one of the hostiles, Mikhail attacks him and Kate, but is overpowered. They tie him up. Sayid reveals a hatch hidden under a rug. Kate and Sayid descend into the hatch while Locke keeps watch over the unconscious Mikhail. The basement is wired with explosives. Sayid finds several DHARMA manuals. Upstairs, Locke is distracted by the prompting of the chess game. He finally manages to beat the chess computer, after which the screen changes to a video of ""Dr. Marvin Candle"" / ""Dr. Mark Wickmund"", which tells him to enter number codes for communication. Since the satellite and sonar have been rendered inoperable, Dr. Candle says, ""Has there been an incursion of the station by the hostiles? If so, enter 7-7."" Locke is about to enter the code when Mikhail appears behind him and holds a knife before his throat. In the basement, Kate is attacked by Bea Klugh (April Grace), but Sayid comes to her defense. Kate retaliates, punching Klugh in the face after recognizing her as one of the Others from the Pala Ferry dock when they were kidnapped, and tells Sayid that she will know where Jack is. They take her upstairs. Locke is outside, being held at gunpoint by Mikhail. There is a lot of arguing in Russian between Klugh and Mikhail,[2] and then Mikhail shoots Klugh. Locke struggles for the gun, and Sayid manages to knock Mikhail to the ground. Mikhail begs to be killed, but Sayid lets him live. Locke watches Dr. Candle's video again, pausing at the ""Enter 7-7"" part. Sayid shows Mikhail a map that shows a cable running from The Flame to a place called ""The Barracks."" Mikhail doesn't tell him about this place on the map, but warns that the moment Sayid's guard is down, he will attack. Danielle agrees with this. ""You have a map,"" she says, ""Why keep him alive?"" Sayid refuses to kill him. Locke emerges and says that he beat the chess game and found out why Mikhail hadn't wanted him to beat it. The farmhouse blows up. Once again, one of Sayid's hopes of being able to communicate with the outside world has been taken away by Locke. As the group turns to leave, Sayid catches sight of the cat. The episode starts off with James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) noticing Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) with one of his magazines; he explains that ""they share things now."" After seeing that the castaways have set up a ping-pong table, Sawyer decides to challenge someone to a game to retrieve his ""stash"". Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) decides that if he loses, he has to give up using colorful nicknames for a week. The ping-pong match begins between Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Sawyer. Sawyer loses badly, but Hurley takes pity on him and returns some of his magazines. At this point, Hurley reassures Sawyer that Kate will be safe while with Sayid and Locke. 12.45 million American viewers watched this episode live.[3] Naveen Andrews submitted this episode for consideration for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.[4]",4681,8.6
Par Avion,3,12,Paul Edwards,Christina M. Kim & Jordan Rosenberg,Claire,2007-03-14,12.48,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_Avion,"""Par Avion"" is the 12th episode of the 3rd season of Lost and the 61st episode overall, making it the exact midpoint of the series. It was aired on March 14, 2007, on ABC. The episode was written by Christina M. Kim and Jordan Rosenberg and directed by Paul Edwards. The character of Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. The episode opens with a Claire Littleton flashback. Claire finds herself in a ruined car. She sees her mother, Carole Littleton, lying in the road, badly injured. At the hospital, Claire's Aunt Lindsey confronts Claire about her being cleaned up. A doctor tells Claire all her mother's medical expenses have been taken care of by an anonymous person. Later, Claire discovers her mother has a visitor, Dr. Christian Shephard (John Terry). She realizes he is the one paying the hospital bills, and asks who he is. Reluctantly, Christian admits that he is her father, meaning Jack and Claire are half-siblings. Later, Christian explains over coffee with Claire that he had a fling with her mother which resulted in Claire's birth. However, Claire's mother did not like that he had another family and told him to stay away. He reveals that the reason he wanted to talk with her is that he wants Claire to think about ending her mother's life. Claire gets angry, believing that Christian is there to ""correct a mistake"" he made by having Claire with her mother. She tells him paying the bill does not make him noble and leaves, after telling him she does not even know his name, and does not want to know it. Back in Sydney, Claire visits her mother, who is still in a persistent vegetative state. Although still in a coma, Claire reveals to her mother she is pregnant but giving away the baby. She tearfully apologizes for the accident and for all the terrible things she said to her in the car before it happened. Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) suggests that Charlie should go boar hunting. Claire sees a glint in a flock of seagulls. Claire realizes that the birds migrate, and that they may be tagged. She decides to capture a bird and attach a note about the crash of Flight 815 and the survivors, hoping that someone will find and read it. After explaining her plan, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) help Claire set up a trap to capture one of the birds. Just as Jin is about to spring the trap, gunshots ring out and scare the birds away. Desmond emerges from the jungle, claiming he was on the trail of a boar. Claire knows it somehow involves Charlie. She confronts Charlie about his and Desmond's strange behavior. Although Charlie struggles with whether to tell Claire about Desmond's prediction, he instead says her plan will only give people false hope. Claire is angry and asks Charlie to leave her alone. Claire, after seeing an argument between Desmond and Charlie, follows Desmond. He picks up a seagull from a rock and explains to Claire how he's seen that if Charlie had gone to get the bird, he would have died after falling into the sea. Claire takes the bird to Charlie and tells him she knows of the visions. Charlie and Claire release the bird, with a note explaining the circumstances of the crash. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) and the captured Other Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff) learn from Mikhail that the implosion at ""The Swan"" station sent an electromagnetic pulse which wiped out an underwater beacon. This makes it impossible for the island to be accurately located, or for anyone to return to the island. Kate asks Mikhail why the Others stay on the island if they have a way off it. Mikhail says that Kate, Locke and Sayid would not understand because they are flawed. They are not on the ""list"" because they are angry (looking at Locke), and weak and frightened (looking at Sayid). The list was made by a ""magnificent man"" who brought all the Others there. When Kate tells Mikhail that Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) is not all that great, Mikhail replies that he is not talking about Ben. Mikhail also reveals he knows their full names and begins to reveal his knowledge of Locke's paraplegic condition, but Rousseau interrupts him when she spots an endless ring of cement pylons that disappear into the jungle as far as the eye can see. Sayid believes that this is a security perimeter. Kate starts to walk through, but Sayid stops her, as he believes the sensors would be triggered. Mikhail claims the system has not worked for years, just like everything else on the island, but Locke simply grabs Mikhail and shoves him between two of the pylons. Then an odd, electronic sound rings out, trapping Mikhail, who says ""thank you"" to Locke. The amplitude of the sound jumps up and Mikhail begins twitching and trembling, blood drips out of his ears and saliva foams at the corners of his mouth. He falls over and spasms violently, appearing to be killed by cerebral hemorrhaging. Sayid angrily confronts Locke about pushing Bakunin through the pylons. Locke replies that he had no way of knowing that the Others had a ""sonic weapon fence."" They argue about Locke’s decision to enter 7-7 resulting in the destruction of the Flame station. Locke retorts that he might not have done it if Sayid had bothered to mention that the entire station was rigged with C-4. Kate asks for the axe so they can climb a tree and avoid the sonic trigger. Sayid gets the axe out of Locke's bag and discovers inside a brick of C-4 from the Flame station. Sayid immediately questions Locke's motives, asking if he really came to rescue Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). Locke states there is no other reason for him to be there than to rescue Jack. They finish the tree bridge and Kate volunteers to climb up first. She climbs over the Pylon and reaches the other side safely. She checks Mikhail, and confirms he is dead. Kate, Sayid, Locke and Rousseau reach the barracks where the Others are staying. Expecting to see Jack in some sort of hostage situation, Locke, Sayid and Kate are shocked to instead see him laughing and throwing a football around with Tom Friendly. The episode garnered 12.48 million American viewers.[2] Emilie de Ravin submitted this episode for consideration for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.[3]",4511,8.3
The Man from Tallahassee,3,13,Jack Bender,Drew Goddard & Jeff Pinkner,Locke,2007-03-21,12.219999999999999,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_Tallahassee,"""The Man from Tallahassee"" is the 13th episode of the 3rd season of Lost, and the 62nd episode overall. It was aired on March 21, 2007, on ABC. The episode was written by Drew Goddard and Jeff Pinkner and directed by Jack Bender. The character of John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. Locke is suffering from depression and becomes a recluse. He goes to a government building and finds out he needs to give unwanted information from him in order to keep getting paid his disability insurance. Later on, in his apartment, he is visited by a young man named Peter Talbot (Patrick J. Adams). Peter reveals Locke's father, con man Anthony Cooper (Kevin Tighe), is trying under the false name ""Adam Seward"" to marry Peter's mother. Locke later goes to a florist shop where his father goes with Peter's mother. Knowing Cooper only wants to marry the woman to take her money, Locke confronts him and warns Cooper to call off the wedding and end it or he will tell the woman the truth. Cooper reluctantly agrees. Later, Locke is approached by two detectives, who tell him Peter is dead. Assuming Peter's death was staged by Cooper, Locke goes to Cooper's condo and confronts him, but Cooper denies any involvement. He says Peter's mother was devastated and called off the wedding, and assures Locke that he can call Peter's mother himself if he wants proof. Locke picks up the phone to call her when Cooper suddenly charges him and shoves him through the window. Locke plummets eight stories to the ground, but survives (shown how in a later episode). As Locke lies in a hospital bed, the two detectives inform him that his father has fled to Mexico and has now disappeared. They leave as a physiotherapist lifts Locke out of bed and places him in his wheelchair for the first time. Locke breaks into tears at not being able to move his legs. Outside the Others' compound, Locke, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) are shocked to see Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) interacting familiarly with the Others, and Kate insists that the Others have done something to him. As Rousseau slips away, they sneak into the compound. Kate enters Jack's house and despite her insistence that she will not leave without him, he refuses to go. The door bursts open and two armed Others apprehend her, bringing along a struggling Sayid. Meanwhile, Locke enters the house of Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). Locke wakes Ben and threatens him, demanding he reveal the location of the submarine. They are interrupted — first by Ben's teenage daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde), whom Locke grabs and hides with in the closet, and then by Tom (M.C. Gainey) and an unseen Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who tells Ben that they captured Kate and Sayid trying to rescue Jack. Ben tells Tom to separate the two and interrogate them, and instructs Richard to bring him ""the man from Tallahassee."" After the two leave, Locke asks Alex to get Sayid's pack, and Ben concludes he is doing so to destroy the Others' submarine. Jack visits the imprisoned Kate to tell her that he made a deal with the Others to let him go home. Alex gets Sayid's pack from him. As she leads Locke to the submarine — not knowing her mother is watching her from the bushes — Alex tells Locke that Ben is manipulating him, because he manipulates everyone. After Jack confronts Ben, demanding his friends be released after he leaves the island, Jack and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) are escorted to the dock. They run into Locke as he is walking back up the dock. Jack asks what he's doing there; Locke simply replies ""I'm sorry"" as the submarine explodes behind him. Later, Locke is locked in a room in the DHARMA barracks. Ben and Richard open the door, and Locke reveals that he knows Ben wanted him to blow up the sub. Ben reveals that he wanted to find a way to keep Jack from leaving the island, but did not know how to; Locke had solved this problem. Ben and Richard lead Locke down a hallway, and Ben tells him that, for whatever reason, Locke is ""in communion"" with the island, and that makes him ""very, very important."" Ben then takes Locke to a room where his father, Anthony Cooper (Kevin Tighe), is being held captive. Exposé can be heard on the TV Locke watches in his apartment. During the last flashback, you can see Anthony Cooper serving a bottle of MacCutcheon 60 Whisky to Locke, the same type used by Mr. Widmore (Penelope's father) and Desmond, Charlie and Hurley in 'Flashes Before Your Eyes', and Sayid in 'He's Our You' For the scene where Locke is thrown out the window, the footage of Terry O'Quinn ended when Locke is behind a pillar. Afterwards it is a stunt double, who also crashed through a fake window. The aerial scene of Locke falling had the same double falling attached to a harness in front of a bluescreen. The submarine was mostly a prop made of painted styrofoam over a steel structure, but its interior was shot inside the SS-287 at the USS Arizona Memorial.[2] Terry O'Quinn submitted this episode for consideration for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, an award he would go on to win. It was also sent for consideration for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series.[3]",5245,9.1
Exposé,3,14,Stephen Williams,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Nikki & Paulo,2007-03-28,11.52,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expos%C3%A9_(Lost),"""Exposé"" is the 14th episode of the 3rd season and 63rd episode overall of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC)'s serial drama television series Lost. It aired on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada on March 28, 2007. The episode was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by Stephen Williams. The episode's story focuses on couple Nikki Fernandez (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro). The flashbacks reveal their lives before arriving on the island, and what they have been doing between day one and day eighty-one. Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) returned for the fifth time since his death late in the first season. Furthermore, Ethan (William Mapother) and Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) reprised their guest roles in flashbacks. The episode got a mixed response from critics and fans, with positive reception considering it an entertaining send-off to two unpopular characters, but negative reviews deemed it unnecessary. The flashbacks begin with Nikki Fernandez (Kiele Sanchez) acting in a popular, Charlie's Angels-like TV show Exposé filmed in Sydney, in which she is a guest star. She is also having an affair with the septuagenarian executive producer, Howard L. Zuckerman, who is very wealthy, while Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) works as his chef. Paulo kills Zuckerman by poisoning his food, and the couple steals his diamonds, which are worth $8 million. The couple plan on returning to the United States on Oceanic Flight 815, encountering Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) at the airport. Upon surviving the plane crash, Nikki and Paulo realize that they have lost the bag with the diamonds. Nikki consults Dr. Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), who tells her of a spider with the ability to paralyze people. He also gives her a trajectory map which leads them to The Pearl and the Nigerian plane; they explore neither. When Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) mentions that she found luggage from the plane in a lake, Paulo finds the diamonds, but does not tell Nikki. Instead, he hides them in the toilet at The Pearl and overhears a conversation between Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). The two accidentally leave behind a walkie-talkie that Paulo takes. Later, when Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), Nikki and Paulo visit The Pearl, Paulo retrieves the diamonds by pretending to use the bathroom. Nikki figures out that Paulo has found the diamonds without telling her and decides to lure him into a trap. When he denies that he has the diamonds she unleashes one of the paralyzing spiders on him. She finds the diamonds and Paulo apologizes, claiming that he did it so that she would not end their relationship. Nikki hears The Monster's chittering sounds[2] which distract her long enough for the pheromones of the female spider to attract a group of the male spiders of the same species and she is bitten on her leg. She buries the diamonds and sprints to the beach. Nikki then runs onto the beach, before collapsing where Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) are playing ping pong. As Hurley and Sawyer rush to her, she says something barely audible. She is soon pronounced dead. Hurley and Sawyer try to recount what Nikki said before she died and come to the conclusion that she said, ""Paulo lies"", although she actually said ""paralyzed"". Sawyer and Hurley begin an investigation and find Paulo lying lifeless in the jungle. Sawyer finds a walkie talkie in Nikki and Paulo's tent, and concludes they were working with the Others, due to the similarity. Hurley does not think the Others are near their camp, but Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) reminds them that she was abducted nearby (unaware that it was Charlie who grabbed her). Sawyer tries to calm them down and says he will do a perimeter sweep. Meanwhile, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), who feels guilty, confesses to Sun that it was he who attempted to kidnap her. She says nothing and walks away. Sawyer returns, having found the diamonds, and the other survivors accuse him of being the killer because Desmond saw him arguing with Nikki just that morning. He gives the diamonds to Sun, but she later confronts him about kidnapping her and returns the diamonds because ""they're worthless here."" The survivors then hold a funeral for Nikki and Paulo, where Sawyer pours the pouch of diamonds into the grave. Nikki's eyelids open just as Hurley and Sawyer are filling the grave, burying her and Paulo alive. ""Exposé"" was the fourteenth episode of the series directed by Stephen Williams, and the ninth written by the screenwriting duo Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Kitsis and Horowitz intended to make the episode an homage to film noir, with two con artists who did the ""perfect crime"", that eventually goes wrong due to them getting stranded on the island. A reference to the genre was added by having Sawyer read Agatha Christie's Evil Under the Sun. A recurring theme is Nikki and Paulo's selfishness, which eventually leads to their deaths due to them being greedy and ""too focused on their own petty needs to really care about anyone else"".[3] The flashbacks of ""Exposé"" would show how Nikki and Paulo were always on the island by making them appear in important previous events.[3] The scene set after the crash mixes actual scenes and unused footage of the pilot episode, along with new footage shot in the original location of Mokulēʻia beach. Since not all pieces of the wreckage were found, a few were added with greenscreen effects.[4] The scene with Jack's speech intersperses new scenes with footage from ""White Rabbit"". Other continuity nods were considered, such as Paulo finding Shannon's inhaler from ""Confidence Man"", Nikki seeing Boone and Locke carrying shovels to excavate the hatch,[3] and a filmed, but deleted scene where Nikki sees the sky turning purple.[5] During season one, the writers had the idea of introducing a character who was an actress and also created the outline of the fictional show where she would work Exposé. The ""long, daunting hours"" on the writer's room would sometimes lead to creating episodes of the fictional show, with ten being done when the Nikki-centered episode was written. Originally, there was going to be an entire flashback episode in which Nikki was going to be a crime-fighting stripper, only to have it revealed that she was actually an actress. The idea was shortened to just one flashback spot. The role of Mr. LaShade was written with Billy Dee Williams in mind and, when he was cast, the color scheme of LaShade's hat was chosen in reference to his costume worn in his famed role as Lando Calrissian.[3] Nikki and Paulo were killed off due to being disliked by much of Lost's fan base. Show runner Damon Lindelof admitted that the couple were ""universally despised"" by fans.[6] Lindelof explained that ""back when we (the producers) had more good faith with the audience, we could have gotten away with these shenanigans. Given the backlash against them, we had to clean up the mess."" The decision to kill them off in one flashback episode was decided by the producers in December 2006.[7] It was also stated by Lindelof and fellow show runners Carlton Cuse that despite Nikki and Paulo's bad reception, they felt the episode was necessary to explain their original plan of introducing former background characters to the main cast.[8] Lindelof suggested having the characters be buried alive.[3] Although actress Kiele Sanchez said that she wasn't bothered by the general dislike of her character, she was very nervous during the burial scene, because she has claustrophobia.[9] Speculation about the duo's deaths began months before the actual episode aired. Santoro said in an interview with Brazilian Rolling Stone that his character was going to die in the middle of the third season.[10] Another clue about the deaths came when it was announced that Sanchez was signed on to film a fall 2007 pilot for the ABC show, Football Wives.[11] ""Exposé"" had 11.25 million viewers upon its first US broadcast, being ABC's third most watched show of the week – behind the performance show and results of Dancing with the Stars – and placing Lost at the eighteenth spot on the overall weekly ranking.[12] It also attracted 1.089 million viewers in Canada, being the fourth most watched show of the night,[13] and 961,000 viewers in the United Kingdom, being Sky One's most watched show of the week.[14] ""Exposé"" received mixed reviews. Lindelof admitted that the episode ""created a varying degree of fan reaction"", with some fans even describing it as ""filler"". But Cuse defended ""Exposé"", saying it was ""a little bit more of an anthology episode for the show"", and that he felt that ""it's unrealistic, in a show that is now 72 episodes in, that every episode is gonna be, you know, chock full of plot momentum. I think it's entirely reasonable, and we sort of by necessity have to have episodes that aren't super-narratively, you know, propelled.""[8] Daniel of TMZ.com said that the episode ""was a complete waste of time"", and that although he ""wanted Nikki and Paulo to die"", he did not think their deaths warranted an entire episode.[15]Entertainment Weekly's Jeff Jensen wrote that although he liked the cameo appearance of Billy Dee Williams, he did not think ""Exposé"" ""will do much to change anyone's minds"" about Nikki and Paulo, who were already unpopular characters.[16] Brooke Tarnoff, a writer for UGO.com, wrote that she was ""embarrassed"" for Lost.[17]New York Magazine put ""Exposé"" at the top of its list of ""Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes"".[18] However, TV Guide's Matt Roush very much praised the episode for ""weaving flashbacks that appeared to be posthumous but really weren't while providing clever new angles on classic Lost moments from previous seasons"", Roush went on to say that ""Exposé"" was ""a welcome reminder that sometimes these producers really do seem to know what they're doing after all.""[19] Chris Carabott of IGN also gave a positive review, stating that while Nikki and Paulo had no real impact on the overall storyline, ""their ultimate end made for an entertaining hour of television"".[20] The IGN staff later ranked ""Exposé"" 58th out of the 113 Lost episodes, describing it as ""one of the series' darkest and most fun episodes"".[21]",5475,8.1
Left Behind,3,15,Karen Gaviola,Damon Lindelof & Elizabeth Sarnoff,Kate,2007-04-04,11.66,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Behind_(Lost),"""Left Behind"" is the 15th episode of the 3rd season of Lost. It was aired on April 4, 2007, making it the 64th episode of the series. The episode was written by Damon Lindelof and Elizabeth Sarnoff and directed by Karen Gaviola. The character of Kate is featured in the episode's flashbacks.[2][3] In a flashback to Iowa, Kate's car breaks down and is towed into a service station. She overhears a man and a woman arguing. The woman is Cassidy, whom Sawyer trained to be a grifter and all of whose money he stole in the flashbacks of a previous episode. She is working the jewelry con on the man. He thinks the necklaces are fake and wants to call the police, but Kate tells him that her father was a jeweler and that the jewelry is not fake, dissuading the man from calling. Cassidy asks Kate why she didn't want the police to be called; later, over drinks at a bar, Kate explains that her stepfather was a bad man, so she killed him, escaped from the US marshal who arrested her, and now is back in Iowa to talk to her mother. Cassidy offers to help. She says she was conned and embarrassed by a ""bad guy"" as well (referring to Sawyer) and that one of them deserves something good. Back in Iowa, Kate knocks on her mother's door. Diane opens the door, but before she can say anything, cops surround Kate and cuff her. Marshal Mars walks out only to realize that it is not Kate; it is Cassidy dressed as Kate, who claims to be just selling Bibles. Watching through binoculars from down the street is the real Kate, and she realizes just what she is up against - the police are paying very close watch to her mom so she will have a hard time securing contact with her. Later at the motel, Kate reveals that her mother gave her up to the police, despite Kate taking out an insurance policy on the home before buying it to set her mother up for life. Kate wants to know why her mom betrayed her and chose her abusive husband over her. Cassidy goes to the restaurant where Kate's mom works and 'accidentally' dumps a bowl of chili on her. Diane goes to the bathroom to clean up; Kate is waiting there for her. Diane tells Kate that she killed the man she loved, and she asserts that she didn't choose that she loved him. Kate replies that Wayne abused her, but Diane simply snaps back that she didn't kill Wayne for anyone but herself. Diane promises not to contact the police, but says she will if she sees Kate again. Kate begins to tear up, emotional. In a flashback to Iowa, Cassidy drops Kate off at the service station. Cassidy tells her she is pregnant, by the same man who conned her (Sawyer). She wants him dead, yet she still loves him. Kate says to call the cops and have him locked up. Cassidy asks if Kate would forgive her mom for calling the cops. Kate says no, but that this guy has it coming. Kate is held captive by The Others and still handcuffed. When Juliet comes to bring her food, Kate attempts to attack her, but Juliet quickly overpowers her. Soon after, Locke comes in to say that he is abandoning her and leaving with the Others. Locke tells her he does not want to go home; he explains that he made a strong case for her but then they told him who she was and what she had done, he knew that they would likely not forgive her. Back at the barracks, Kate hears noises outside, looks through the screen and sees the Others packing to leave. They all put on gas masks, then the door to the recreation center flies open, someone tosses in a canister and slams the door shut. The canister pops open and gas starts fuming out, knocking her out cold. She wakes up in the jungle, handcuffed to Juliet. Kate takes Juliet's knife and tries unsuccessfully to unlock the handcuffs. Kate says they are going back for her friends. As Kate follows a trail leading to the barracks, they end up getting into a fight about Jack and Kate dislocates Juliet's shoulder. Juliet's yell of pain attracts the smoke monster, and they quickly run into the roots of a banyan tree for cover. The Monster roils up in front of them, and Juliet's face is lit up by a series of bright flashes of light. The monster then retreats, leaving Juliet terrified. She claims to have never seen the monster before. Juliet reveals that Jack told Kate not to come back for him, not because he does not want Kate to be harmed, but because she broke his heart. Then, as Kate calms Juliet down, Juliet asks Kate to put her shoulder back in place, and after doing so, they fall asleep. Kate and Juliet continue to the barracks; however, the monster returns. They take off running, and come upon the pylons. Kate jerks Juliet to a stop and says they cannot go through them. Juliet reaches into her back pocket, takes out a key, and unlocks the cuffs. She then runs to a pylon, enters an access code on a key pad, and they run across the barrier. Juliet jams the setting into the red zone, enabling the previously disabled pylons that send a powerful sonic wave to anything that tries to pass between them. The monster zooms in and bounces off the barrier. It roils and rises, making awful noises, and is unable to pass through the fence. Then it quickly flies away. Kate asks about the key. Juliet says she was left behind, too, and by people she knew and trusted. She hoped that if Kate thought they were in it together, Kate would not leave her behind in the jungle like they did. Kate unlocks her cuff, and they continue on and reach the barracks. Everyone appears to be gone. Juliet goes to look for Sayid, and Kate goes to get Jack, finding him unconscious on the floor of his house. Kate wakes him up and tells him the Others left because of her. She apologizes and cries for messing up his plans to go home, he ignores her and asks where Juliet is. Kate pulls back emotionally, telling him that they left her, too. They join Juliet and Sayid. Jack suggests taking what they can find and starting back before dark. Sayid objects to Juliet coming with them, but Jack is insistent. Kate and Sayid trade looks, both worried about this new development, and head out. Back at the beach, Hurley tells Sawyer that after the Nikki and Paulo situation with the diamonds, the camp is going to vote on whether or not to ""banish"" him. Hurley says there are benefits to living as part of a society and suggests he make amends to fix things. Sawyer tells Hurley he is ready to make amends. He apologizes to Hurley for calling him all those names, is nice to Claire and gives her a blanket for the baby and tells her that Aaron looks less wrinkled since the last time Sawyer saw him, and partners with Desmond to hunt for boar and provide food for the camp. Later, Sawyer roasts the boar and everyone eats. Charlie tells Sawyer he had not heard about any vote, and Sawyer realizes he was conned by Hurley into being nice. Hurley explains that with Jack, Locke, Kate and Sayid gone, Sawyer is all they have, and is the de facto leader. Sawyer dislikes this idea, but Hurley insists that while Jack didn't like it either, it didn't change the fact that all eyes were on him. Sawyer sees how happy he made people and attempts to keep the good vibes going, even offering to hold Aaron for Claire.

One of Us,3,16,Jack Bender,Carlton Cuse & Drew Goddard,Juliet,2007-04-11,12.09,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_Us_(Lost),"""One of Us"" is the 16th episode of the third season of Lost. It aired on April 11, 2007, making it the 65th episode of the series. The episode was written by Carlton Cuse and Drew Goddard and directed by Jack Bender. The title of the episode is not only a reference to the season two episode titled ""One of Them"", it is also a major theme of the episode, as Jack tries to convince the other flight survivors that Juliet is ""one of us"", rather than an Other. The character of Dr. Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) is featured in the episode's flashbacks,[2] which reveal how Juliet got on the Island and why she went to the island in the first place. While on the island, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Juliet trek back to the beach camp, and Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) is struck by a mysterious illness. Andrew Divoff, William Mapother, Brett Cullen and Nestor Carbonell again reprise their recurring roles as Others; Mikhail Bakunin, Ethan Rom, Goodwin and Richard Alpert. The Island events in this episode take place between December 13 and December 15, 2004. Juliet arrives at an airport with her sister, where Richard Alpert and Ethan Rom are there to escort her the rest of the way. Juliet says good-bye to her sister, Rachel, promising to be back before her baby is born. In the airport terminal, Alpert pours sedative into a glass of orange juice and gives it to Juliet to drink, explaining that the trip is very intense. Juliet is wary of drinking the juice, even though she is okay with the other circumstances surrounding the trip. Alpert interrupts and tells her the place she is going is very special and that she has a gift with which she is supposed to do something significant. Juliet drinks the orange juice and passes out. She wakes up in a submarine with her arms and waist strapped down for safety. She then moves out onto a dock, where she meets Ben Linus. Juliet is shown operating with Ethan and Goodwin (Brett Cullen) on a pregnant patient, Sabine, who dies; she is comforted by Goodwin. Juliet meets with Ben, and explains her theory that the problems with pregnant women happen at conception. She wants to test this theory by having a woman conceive off the island, but Ben refuses to let anyone off the island. When Juliet tells him that nothing else can be done and asks to go home and be with her sister, Ben informs Juliet that her sister's cancer has come back. He offers her a choice: either Juliet can go home and be with her sister as she dies, or she can stay and he will have Jacob cure her sister's cancer. Juliet is in bed after sleeping with Goodwin. Afterwards, she is given x-rays of Ben's back, and when she determines that Ben has a tumor, she confronts him and accuses him of lying about Rachel. He denies lying to her and refuses to let her go home. The next day, immediately after Flight 815 crashes, Ben takes Juliet to the Flame Station to see Mikhail. Ben tells Mikhail that he wants information on all of the passengers of the plane, then asks him to bring up a live feed. On the screen a newspaper is shown with the current date, September 22, 2004, followed by a shot of Rachel playing with her child (Rachel named her son Julian, presumably after Juliet) in a playground, and Ben explains that her cancer is in complete remission. The final flashback shows Juliet and Ben discussing their plans immediately before the events of ""Left Behind"". Ben tells her to handcuff herself to Kate and say she was left behind. She is also told that Claire's ""implant"" has been ""activated"" and that this will make Claire ill. Juliet is to use drugs left at the drop point to cure her and earn the trust of the survivors; Ben gives her a gas mask and leaves. Jack Shephard, Kate Austen, Sayid Jarrah and Juliet Burke move back to the beach camp. As they stop for the night, Jack explains to Kate the deal he made with Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). Sayid attempts to interrogate Juliet, but Jack intervenes and defends her. At the beach camp, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) hears Claire Littleton's baby, Aaron, crying and wakes up Claire. Claire says she is not feeling well, so Charlie offers to take care of Aaron. James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) sees Jack, Kate, and Sayid returning. Though happy about their return, he expresses his displeasure at seeing Juliet. Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) engages Juliet in casual conversation. Juliet guesses that Hurley was sent to keep an eye on her. He tells her the last Other who came over, Ethan, was killed and buried nearby. That night, Jack tells everyone that he trusts Juliet and that should be enough, but Sayid disagrees. Jack continues to explain that John Locke blew up the submarine that was to take him home. Claire suddenly collapses with blood gushing from her face. Juliet takes Jack and Kate aside and tells them she knows what's wrong with Claire because she did it to her. At the camp, Juliet explains that Claire's immune system has turned against her due to a latent reaction to medication in her bloodstream. The medication was designed by Juliet to keep Claire alive during her pregnancy. She was brought to the island to find out why women couldn't have children. The mother's body treats the pregnancy as a foreign invader and the immune system attacks; every pregnant woman on the island has died. Claire was the first to survive even though she showed some of the symptoms. Juliet explains that Ethan kept a stash of the serum at a nearby drop point. She goes out into the jungle and retrieves the serum, but Sayid and Sawyer have followed her, and they want answers. Juliet tells them there is no time, and realizing they are not going to budge, she stands up to them and says she finds it interesting that they are the camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he will not be able to protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her ""one of us."" Later, while setting up her shelter and remembering her last conversation with Ben, Juliet looks around the camp and ties a final double knot as Jack smiles at her. ""One of Us"" was the nineteenth episode directed by Jack Bender. It was written by Carlton Cuse and Drew Goddard; the pair had never before collaborated on an episode. As usual, the scenes on the beach (the survivors camp) were shot at Oahu's Papa'iloa Beach, while the island scenes were actually filmed at the Waialua Mauka Ranches. The Mittelos secure building exterior scenes were shot at the Honolulu Advertiser Production and Distribution Building. Most of the scenes displaying the Others' camp were shot at the Hawaii Film Studio, with the exception of the barracks which were filmed at YMCA Camp Erdman. The inside of the submarine was filmed inside the SS-287 which is located at the USS Arizona Memorial.[3] Once again, the song ""Downtown"" by Petula Clark was used in flashbacks; it was already used in the earlier episode ""A Tale of Two Cities"".[4][5] ""One of Us"" was watched by 12.09 million Americans, ranking Lost as the twentieth most watched program of the week.[6]Lost defeated CBS' CSI: NY by 53% among adults 18-49, the largest ever margin of victory for Lost over CSI: NY in original episodes. The ratings were also an increase over the previous episode, and improved the timeslot by 5.7 million viewers over the same night last year. Lost was the fifth most watched program for the week in the key adults 18-49 demographic, achieving 5.2 million viewers.[7] In the United Kingdom, the episode attracted 1.09 million viewers, and was the second most watched program of the week on the non-terrestrial channels, beaten only by Live FA Cup Football.[8] Reviewer Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode with an 8.7 out of 10, commenting that ""One of Us"" was ""yet another solid effort from long-time Lost director Jack Bender who deserves credit for bringing us some of the best episodes the series has to offer. Bender has helmed ""Walkabout"", ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"" and this season's best ""The Man from Tallahassee"" just to name a few"".[9] Mitchell submitted this episode for consideration for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.[10]",4597,8.7
Catch-22,3,17,Stephen Williams,Jeff Pinkner & Brian K. Vaughan,Desmond,2007-04-18,12.08,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_(Lost),"""Catch-22"" is the 17th episode of the third season of Lost, and the 66th episode overall. It was aired in the United States on April 18, 2007, on ABC. The episode was written by Jeff Pinkner and Brian K. Vaughan, and directed by Stephen Williams. The character of Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. Flashbacks in this episode show Desmond ending his test period of silence after joining a monastery. He is greeted by Brother Campbell, who welcomes him to the abbey. The two quickly get along, and one day they are applying the labels for wine bottles. While they are talking, a monk enters and informs Desmond of a visitor. A man then enters and punches Desmond before leaving. Desmond decides to visit an old flame, whom he was supposed to marry after six years of dating, but jilted her a week before the wedding to become a monk. Derek, the man who assaulted him, answers the door, but is quickly interrupted by Ruth, Desmond's old love. She invites him in, where he explains that he was called to join the monastery. However, Ruth accuses him of being scared and accuses him of not having the decency to come clean when breaking up with a woman. Later that night, Desmond gets drunk on the wine that he helped label. Brother Campbell catches him and informs him that he is not cut out for the monastery. However, the next day, he asks Desmond to help load the crates of wine into the car of a customer. (As Desmond is talking to Brother Campbell, the scene shows a picture on his desk of Brother Campbell and Eloise Hawking.) As he wheels them out, he meets the customer, Penny Widmore, who offers to take him with her. The episode starts off with Desmond, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes, Jin-Soo Kwon and Charlie Pace walking through the jungle, talking about superheroes, when Charlie suddenly springs one of Rousseau's traps, and is consequently shot in the throat by an arrow. Desmond tries to give him aid, but Charlie dies in his arms. We then see a string of short flashbacks - Hurley lifting a cable out of the sand, a red light dropping from the sky, Jin and Charlie holding a parachute in the jungle, and a person stuck in a tree. The view then returns to Desmond fishing on the beach, revealing that it was all one of Desmond's visions. He looks over to see that Charlie is still alive and well. Desmond approaches Hurley and asks him to take him to the cable. Hurley pretends not to know anything, but eventually Desmond coaxes him into telling him, and also asks him to go with him on a hike. The two visit Jack to pick up a first-aid kit, with Desmond telling him that he has a sprained ankle. Jack is skeptical at first, but eventually hands it over. Hurley then demands that Desmond tells him what he's up to. Desmond explains that he experienced more visions, but they weren't shown in order, so everything needs to happen exactly as it appeared. Meanwhile, Kate is approached by Sawyer in her tent while she is changing, and he asks her if Jack knows about their fling while in captivity. She explains that Jack saw them having sex through the surveillance monitors. Sawyer tries flirting with her, but Kate playfully shrugs him off. Desmond gets Hurley to speak with Jin, who comes along after being told about a ""camping trip."" Desmond then approaches Charlie with the same story, but Charlie sees through this and questions him about his visions. Desmond gives in and explains, but only a limited amount to convince Charlie to come along. They walk along the beach, up until the point where Hurley first discovered the cable. Desmond suggests that they camp out here until the next morning, causing Charlie to become wary. Meanwhile, back at the camp, Kate and Jack have a talk in the kitchen, and reminisce about days on the island. Kate tries communicating with Jack and tries to get things back to normal between the two, but he asks to use her spoon and heads off to Juliet's tent where he eats dinner with her. Kate becomes upset, so she goes to Sawyer's tent and seduces him. ""Camping trip"" company is enjoying a ghost story told by Jin (in Korean), while gathered around a campfire. Charlie notices Desmond is looking at the photo of him and Penny. Charlie asks how he could leave someone so beautiful. Desmond replies that he is a coward. Their conversation is interrupted by the sound of an approaching helicopter. Thinking that they are being rescued, they suddenly notice the helicopter doesn't sound right, and they hear it crash into the ocean. Jin, however, spots a beacon flashing in the sky, landing somewhere in the jungle. Desmond is eager to follow, but Charlie suggests they wait until morning. Reluctantly, Desmond agrees. Jack and Juliet talk as they continue to construct her tent back on the beach. They are soon confronted by Sawyer, who challenges Jack to a game of ping-pong. When Sawyer says how strange it is to be back, Jack reveals that he spoke with Kate the night before, but ate supper with Juliet. The next morning, Desmond, Charlie, Jin and Hurley venture off into the jungle. Charlie stumbles across a small Hawaiian doll, which they at first mistake for one of Rousseau's traps. Desmond then discovers a rucksack wedged in a tree above Hurley and retrieves it. Inside, they find a satellite phone, which has stopped working, and a book titled Ardil-22 (the Portuguese translation of Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22). Inside, Desmond finds a perfect copy of the photograph with him and Penny, causing him and Charlie to suspect that Penny is the person who parachuted on the island. Sawyer confronts Kate and gives her a cassette tape (the Best of Phil Collins), which he stole from Bernard. He then questions her about why she jumped him, asking her if she was upset about Jack and Juliet. Sawyer accuses her of using him and tells her ""all you have to do is ask"" before walking away, leaving her upset. Still in the jungle, Desmond and Charlie discuss his reasons for bringing them on the hike. It soon starts raining, and Desmond is eager for the group to pick up the pace. Hurley and Charlie discuss who is faster, Superman or The Flash, as seen in Desmond's vision at the start of the episode. As also foreseen, Charlie activates the trap that is supposed to kill him. Desmond, however, pushes him to the ground, saving his life and narrowly avoiding the arrow. Charlie immediately understands that Desmond knew it would happen. As they continue onwards, Jin and Desmond are unable to decide which direction to go. Hurley suggests that he and Charlie go one way while Jin and Desmond go another. Charlie immediately declines and wants to go with Desmond. When they are alone, Charlie yells at Desmond for not telling him the truth about his visions, to which he responds that ""it would be pointless for Desmond to save him, as it will keep happening over again"", referring it to a 'test of God'. Jin suddenly calls for them, as he and Hurley have discovered the beacon and the parachutist hanging motionless from the trees. Desmond climbs the tree and cuts off the parachute, so Jin, Charlie and Hurley can use it as a safety net for when Desmond cuts the pilot free. Convinced that he will be finally reunited with Penny, Desmond quickly removes the helmet, only to discover that she is a different woman (Naomi). As the episode concludes, she mutters Desmond's name. Marsha Thomason's character was originally credited as ""parachutist"" in the official press release,[2] before it was revised to give her character the name Naomi.[3] The episode received 12.08 million American viewers.[4]IGN's Chris Carabott wrote that ""the thought of the normally good-hearted and endearing Desmond leading Charlie to his death is an intriguing premise"", but was critical of the love-triangle subplot, calling it a ""step back"".[5]",4427,8.5
D.O.C.,3,18,Frederick E.O. Toye,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Sun,2007-04-25,11.860000000000001,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.O.C._(Lost),"""D.O.C."" is the 18th episode of the 3rd season of Lost and the 67th episode overall. It was aired on April 25, 2007. The episode was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by Fred Toye. The character of Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. The title is a reference to the medical phrase of the same name which stands for ""date of conception"", referring to the episode's plot of discovering Sun's D.O.C. In flashbacks, we see Sun in a park. A middle-aged woman sitting next to her points out Sun's wedding photograph with Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) in the newspaper and inquires if that's her. Sun affirms that it is. The woman suggests that it would be embarrassing if the world were to find out that a daughter from the wealthy Paik family had married a man whose mother is a prostitute. The woman demands money as blackmail. Later, Sun asks her husband about his family. He tells her that his mother died when he was a child, then gives conflicting stories on when his father died. When she pushes for more information, he grows angry and asks her to drop the issue. Sun visits Jin's father without his knowledge, who confirms the woman's story. He never told Jin his mother was a prostitute and is still alive, and pleads with Sun not to tell his son the truth. He also mentions that he raised Jin alone and is not even sure he is his biological father. Sun then visits her father (Byron Chung) and asks for the money. When he demands a reason, she tells him that she has never pried into his affairs, which are clearly illegal, and would like the same respect. However, she admits that the money will prevent great shame coming to someone she loves. Mr. Paik realizes she means Jin, and tells her that he will bear the debt by working for him directly, instead of as a floor manager. Jin discovers the money in Sun's purse. She concedes she got it from her father, but claims it was just for furniture and their honeymoon. Jin says he doesn't want to be any further in her father's debt, and asks her to return it. Sun agrees, then goes directly to the park, where the woman is waiting. She gives her the money, then reveals that she knows the woman's identity: she is Jin's biological mother. The blackmailer callously shrugs this off and Sun threatens to have her father kill the woman if she reveals her existence to Jin. On the island, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) inquires about Sun's pregnancy in a manner that arouses her suspicions. Sun asks Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) about Jack's loyalty. Kate suggests she talk to Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), who reveals that pregnant women die on the island. Juliet convinces Sun to leave with her to go to The Staff. It is revealed that women who conceive on the island do not survive. Sun says Jin was infertile before coming to the island; also that she had an affair with Jae Lee before the crash. She fears revealing these facts to Jin. The tests reveal the conception took place after the crash; hence, Jin is the father. Juliet secretly leaves a message for Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) on a tape recorder, explaining her findings with Sun, and promising to get a sample from Austen (Kate). She then stops the tape and whispers, ""I hate you."" Meanwhile, Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), Jin and Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) are arguing how to care for the parachutist, Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason). Hurley accidentally shoots off a flare. Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff), thought to have died in an earlier episode, appears shortly thereafter. He attempts to flee but Jin subdues him. The other three question him, revealing that Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Kate and John Locke told them how he'd been supposedly killed by the sonic fence. Mikhail says he was a field medic and offers to help save the parachutist's life, if they promise to let him go. The woman fades in and out of consciousness, at one point asking in Mandarin Chinese, what happened. She also tells them, in Portuguese that she is not alone. Mikhail seems to understand this but tells Desmond that she merely said ""Thank you."" He keeps his word and they keep theirs. Jin stops Mikhail from taking the phone. The man is allowed to leave empty-handed. The parachutist asks Hugo who he is and Hugo tells her that he was on Oceanic Flight 815. On his response she says ""That's not possible"" because ""They found the plane. There were no survivors. They were all dead.""",4394,8.2
The Brig,3,19,Eric Laneuville,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,Locke,2007-05-02,12.33,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brig_(Lost),"""The Brig"" is the 19th episode of the 3rd season of Lost, and the 68th episode overall. It aired on May 2, 2007. The episode was written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by Eric Laneuville. The character of John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is featured in the episode's flashbacks, focusing on his time with The Others. Flashbacks show the past eight days from Locke's perspective. Locke asks Ben and Tom why his father, Anthony Cooper (Kevin Tighe), is on the island and, when he ungags him, Cooper viciously bites him. As they leave, Ben invites Locke to join them as they prepare to abandon their living quarters, and Locke accepts. A few days later, Locke and the rest of the Others set up camp in a clearing in the middle of the jungle. As Locke helps Cindy Chandler (Kimberley Joseph) put up her tent, she tells him that the Others are excited that he's here with them. Ben summons Locke that night and tells him that he must kill Cooper in order to become one of them. The Others have gathered to watch, but Locke is unable to kill Cooper, despite his father's contemptuous taunting of him. The next morning, while Locke is on a hillside overlooking the camp, Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) joins him. He explains that Ben knew Locke wasn't going to kill his own father, and wanted to embarrass him. Richard tells Locke that if he won't kill Cooper, then someone else should: Sawyer. The next day, Locke wakes to find that the Others have packed up and are ready to move on. Ben tells him they will leave a trail for him, that he must stay behind with Cooper and ""clean up his mess"", and that if he doesn't bring his father's body with him, then not to bother following. Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) wakes up during the night next to James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), she explains she can only sleep in her own tent. She kisses him goodnight and leaves. Sawyer slips a handgun into his waistband and steps outside to urinate. He briefly converses with Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), who are standing outside a tent. Inside the jungle, Sawyer is confronted by Locke, who has been gone for a week. Locke tells him that he has infiltrated the Others' camp and has taken their leader, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), hostage, and needs Sawyer to kill him. Sawyer questions why Locke would come to him, and Locke explains that, thanks to the files the Others have on all of the Flight 815 survivors, he knows that Sawyer killed a man (Jeff Perry) in Sydney (this scene was shown in an episode from season one). Locke turns and leaves, and Sawyer reluctantly follows, barefooted. As Locke and Sawyer trek through the jungle, Locke proceeds to reel off certain points of Sawyer's life, provoking Sawyer to attack him and threaten him with a knife. Locke admits that he cannot bring himself to kill Ben, whereas Sawyer reveals that he killed the wrong person by mistake and he didn't mean to kill the man he killed. Locke leads Sawyer to the Black Rock, the derelict slave ship seen in a previous episode, taking him inside to the brig where a man sits chained, gagged and hooded. Locke locks Sawyer in the brig with the prisoner, ignoring Sawyer's enraged pleas to unlock the door. Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) enters the Black Rock and is surprised to see Locke. She explains she is looking for dynamite. Locke does not give an explanation for his presence or for Sawyer's banging on the door, but he does point her to the dynamite; she takes a crate and leaves. In the brig, Sawyer threatens to shoot Locke through the door if he won't open it, but Locke tells him that if his gun had bullets he would have threatened him with it, and not a knife, in the jungle. An angered Sawyer removes the prisoner's hood and is startled to see it is not Ben, but in fact Cooper. Both are equally confused, but Cooper explains that he was involved in a car collision and the last thing he remembers is being lifted into the ambulance as the paramedics placed an I.V. needle in him. In accordance with what island newcomer Naomi claims, Cooper comments that Oceanic Flight 815 crashed in the middle of the ocean killing all those onboard, meaning that Locke is supposed to be dead; Cooper has surmised that he is in Hell given that he is now seeing his supposedly dead son. Cooper explains to Sawyer that he is Locke's father, and that he conned Locke out of a kidney and pushed him out an eighth story window because he was a ""nuisance"". Suspicious, Sawyer asks the prisoner for his name. Cooper tells him a con man has many names, and begins to list his, including Tom Sawyer. Upon questioning by Sawyer, Cooper reveals that he has been to Jasper, Alabama (apparently Sawyer's home town). Sawyer realizes Cooper is the ""Sawyer"" that he has been seeking all his life; Cooper is the man who conned Sawyer's mother out of her life savings, which caused Sawyer's father to kill Sawyer's mother before committing suicide. Sawyer orders Cooper to read the letter he wrote as a young boy; after reading the beginning, Cooper admits he took Sawyer's mother's money out of her own request, and tries to convince Sawyer that it is completely Sawyer's dad's fault for what he did to Sawyer's mother and himself. Enraged, Sawyer demands Cooper finish reading, but he tears the letter to pieces. Sawyer then chokes Cooper to death with his chains. Locke frees Sawyer, who vomits outside. Locke tells him that Juliet is a spy for the Others who know Sun is pregnant, and are planning to raid the camp in 3 days; Locke gives him her tape recorder as proof to present to the other survivors. He tells Sawyer he is not returning with him, because he is on his own journey now. Sawyer asks Locke if his father threw him out of a window and if John was a cripple. John answers ""Not anymore"". As the episode ends, Locke throws over his shoulder a sack with his father inside and heads into the jungle. Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) encounters Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) when he goes into the kitchen tent to collect food for Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason), whose presence in the camp remains unknown to all except Charlie, Hurley, Jin and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick). Charlie explains that the camping trip with Desmond, Jin and Hurley was ""male bonding"". Jack tells Charlie that if they plan another one to count him in. Back in the tent, Jin gives Naomi the food while Desmond questions whether Jack's loyalties lie with the survivors or with the Others, namely Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell). Because Naomi still needs medical attention, the four men decide to let Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) in on their secret. On the beach, Sayid tells Charlie he admires his decision not to tell Jack about Naomi. Sayid questions Naomi. She explains that Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger) hired her to search for Desmond, though she has not met her. She also repeats that the wreckage of Flight 815 was found off the shore of Bali, four miles underwater, and ROVs revealed that all passengers on board were dead. While searching for Desmond, she received coordinates which took her to the middle of the ocean. However, on her return to the search vessel, the island mysteriously appeared out of cloud cover, and her helicopter lost power as she managed to bail out. Sayid doubts her story and asks for the whereabouts of her helicopter. Naomi, apparently offended, gives Sayid her satellite phone and quips that she will not rescue him. Back on the beach, Sayid and Hurley try to fix Naomi's radio. Sayid says the technology is more advanced than any he has ever seen. He manages to fix it but the signal is blocked. The noise of the static attracts a curious Kate. At first, Sayid is reluctant, but seeing no other choice, he tells Kate about Naomi, and asks her not to tell Jack. Kate, however, goes straight to Jack who is sitting with Juliet on the beach. She asks to speak privately to him but he says that whatever she has to say can be said in front of Juliet. Kate tells them about Naomi and that he wasn't told because no one on the beach trusts him anymore. Jack and Juliet then debate whether or not to tell Kate something. Juliet wants to, but Jack replies, ""Not yet"". 12.33 million American viewers watched this episode.[2] Kevin Tighe submitted this episode for consideration in the category of ""Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series"" on his behalf for the 2007 Emmy Awards.[3]",5157,9.1
The Man Behind the Curtain,3,20,Bobby Roth,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Drew Goddard,Ben,2007-05-09,12.11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Behind_the_Curtain,"""The Man Behind the Curtain"" is the 20th episode of the 3rd season of Lost, and the 69th episode overall. It was first aired on May 9, 2007, on ABC. The episode was directed by Bobby Roth and written by Elizabeth Sarnoff and Drew Goddard.[2] Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) reluctantly leads John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) to Jacob, the mysterious leader of the Others. The episode is the first to feature flashbacks recounting Ben's backstory. On December 19, 1964, Emily Linus (Carrie Preston), gives birth to her son in a forest. Afterwards, her husband Roger (Jon Gries), carries her and the baby to the roadside outside Portland, where a car carrying Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison) and Olivia (Samantha Mathis) soon stops to help them. Emily dies after telling Roger to name the baby Benjamin. Seven years later, Ben (Sterling Beaumon) and his father arrive at the Island to work for the DHARMA Initiative, of which Horace is a member. At one point, Ben sees another vision of his dead mother. This, along with his drunken father blaming him for his mother's death, prompts Ben to sneak into the jungle in search of her. He encounters Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), one of the ""Hostiles"" who are native to the island. Ben tells Richard that he wants to join the Hostiles on the grounds of not liking the DHARMA Initiative. Richard tells Ben that if he truly wants this, then he must be very, very patient. Years later, Ben, now a young man working for DHARMA, helps his father Roger load a van. (This is the same van that Hurley had found in ""Tricia Tanaka is Dead""). After confronting his father about forgetting his birthday again, Roger suggests they go for a drive together after their work is done, to have some father-son time. After parking atop a hill, Ben asks his father if he blames him for the death of his mother. Roger simply answers ""What do I know"", and promises to try and remember Ben's birthday the following year. But Ben, fed up after years of neglect and abuse, pulls out a gas mask and bids his father goodbye before filling the van with a gas that kills Roger. Ben returns to the barracks, where all the DHARMA workers have died from the same gas, and Alpert and his men emerge wearing masks. As Alpert's men start picking up the bodies, Alpert offers to go and collect Roger's, but Ben tells him to ""leave him out there"". John Locke arrives at the Others' camp carrying his father's body on his back, and demands that Ben tell him everything about the Island. Ben tells him that the true leader of the Others is named Jacob, and denies Locke's request to see him. Ben also tells John that he was not born on the island. Soon after, Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff) stumbles into the camp and talks about a parachutist who landed on the Island, Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason). To convince Ben to bring him before Jacob, Locke beats Mikhail unconscious, while Tom and Richard do not intervene. Ben and Locke arrive at Jacob's cabin. They enter, but Locke cannot see anyone inside. Ben introduces Locke to Jacob and gestures towards an empty chair, to which he starts talking. Locke tells Ben that he is crazy and pathetic. Just as Locke is about to exit the house, an odd and deep voice says ""Help me"". Locke pulls out a flashlight, and suddenly, objects in the room begin to violently fly about, windows shatter, and Ben is flung against a wall as a strange man is briefly seen sitting in the chair. Locke and Ben run out of the house. The following day, Locke still does not believe Jacob is real, and says he will expose Ben as a fraud. Locke notices that Ben is leading them back by a different path, and Ben then leads him to mass grave full of skeletons clothed in DHARMA uniforms. Ben tells Locke that he helped kill his own people when it became clear that the DHARMA workers could not coexist with the natives, and then shoots Locke, who falls into the pit. Locke reveals Jacob said ""Help me"", and Ben replies that he certainly hopes Jacob helps him, as he departs leaving Locke for dead. At the survivors' camp, James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) plays Juliet Burke's (Elizabeth Mitchell) tape for Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly). Later that night, the survivors are introduced to Naomi and the tape is played for all to hear. Just then, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Juliet return to the camp. Juliet tells Sawyer to play the other side of the tape, which is Ben's plan to lead a team to kidnap all the fertile women. Juliet reveals that she has already told Jack about it, and that they were still thinking of a plan. The episode's title references The Wizard of Oz, as the question of how powerful Ben and the Others as a whole are is compared to ""the ferocious and majestical Wizard of Oz, and there was in fact this very small man behind the curtain.""[3] Jacob, the mysterious entity who rules the Others, made its first physical appearance.[4] For the scene in the cabin, actor Michael Emerson wrote Jacob's unspoken lines so that it would seem more like a normal conversation was transpiring between the two.[2] Damon Lindelof describes Richard Alpert's encounter with the young Ben, and Ben and Locke's approach to the cabin as analogous to that of the choosing of the Dalai Lama by the Panchen Lama: ""Richard Alpert might be construed as some sort of a Panchen Lama, as he has a conversation with this boy who sees something that he wasn't supposed to see, and now I think Ben finds himself in the role of Panchen Lama as he brings Locke into this cabin, in an attempt to sort of determine whether the island has chosen him to be its new surrogate.[2] The opening scene, in which we see Ben's mother giving birth to him in a forest, was meant to trick the audience into thinking that the scene took place on the Island - much as the openings of ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities"" were intended to do the opposite. The part of Emily Linus, Ben's mother, was played by actress Carrie Preston, the real-life wife of Michael Emerson. They had also worked together in other works, such as the 2004 film Straight-Jacket.[2] Preston was cast as Ben's mother following Emerson telling people at parties that she was desperate for a part on the show.[5] Director Bobby Roth said the 1970s scenes try to convey the decade's ""full of hope"" spirit, where ""people try to create a new world"". The interior design for the DHARMA installations tried to be utopic, but utilitarian.[6] Michael Emerson submitted this episode for consideration for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, an award he would go on to be nominated for. He lost to fellow cast member Terry O'Quinn for his own submitted episode ""The Man from Tallahassee"".[7]",5802,9.2
Greatest Hits,3,21,Stephen Williams,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Charlie,2007-05-16,12.32,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Hits_(Lost),"""Greatest Hits"" is the 21st episode of the third season of Lost and 70th episode of the series. It was written by co-executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by supervising producer Stephen Williams. The episode first aired on May 16, 2007,[2] on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada. ""Greatest Hits"" was viewed by 12 million Americans and was well received by critics. Lost's editors received a Golden Reel Award nomination. The episode takes place on December 22, 2004, 92 days after the crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. A group of survivors prepare for an upcoming raid on their camp by the ""Others"", while the rest prepare to contact a nearby freighter. Charlie Pace (played by Dominic Monaghan) recounts the five greatest moments of his life, which are depicted in flashbacks, as he prepares to fulfill Desmond Hume's (Henry Ian Cusick) premonitions of his death.[3] The Others' leader Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) orders ten of the Others to go to the survivors' camp to kidnap any pregnant women that night—a night earlier than was scheduled. Ben's adopted daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde) persuades her boyfriend Karl (Blake Bashoff) to canoe to the survivors' beach to warn them. The survivors' leader Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) plans to kill the ambushing Others with dynamite retrieved by island resident Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan).[4]Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) are selected to stay behind to shoot the dynamite-rigged tents when the Others arrive.[5] Desmond tells Charlie about his latest premonition: Charlie's girlfriend Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) and her baby Aaron will escape the island via helicopter if Charlie flips a switch in a Dharma Initiative station and drowns. Sayid tells Jack that he may be able to communicate with the freighter roughly 130 kilometres offshore.[6] He can use the satellite phone of Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason), the helicopter parachutist who landed on the Island. Once he goes to the radio tower to disable Rousseau's distress signal. Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) informs Sayid that this will not work because the underwater ""Looking Glass"" is blocking outgoing transmissions. Sayid realizes that a cable he found seventy days before[7] connects to this station and that they will need someone to go on a probable suicide mission there, and Charlie volunteers.[5] Naomi tells Charlie that his band Drive Shaft released a successful greatest hits album after the crash of Flight 815. Flashbacks show Charlie's ""greatest hits"" of his life, referring to his life's five best moments, in descending order. Charlie writes them down on a note. Before paddling out to the Looking Glass with Desmond, Charlie assures Claire he will be fine, kisses her goodbye and leaves his ring in Aaron's crib. Once Desmond and Charlie arrive over the station, Charlie gives Desmond his note and asks that he give it to Claire. Desmond offers to do the job instead, saying that he suspects that his flashes are recommending him to take Charlie's place. To keep him from doing so, Charlie knocks Desmond out with an oar and dives into the water. Upon entering the station, two Others named Greta (Lana Parrilla) and Bonnie (Tracy Middendorf) appear with guns aimed at Charlie.[8] Most of the island scenes were filmed from April 9, 2007[9] to April 12.[10] A detailed episode synopsis was uploaded online before the episode aired[11] and Disney investigated the leak.[12] The name of the Dharma station in the episode is an allusion to Lewis Carroll's novel Through the Looking-Glass.[13] Dominic Monaghan was inspired by Leonardo DiCaprio's underwater performance in Titanic and opened his mouth briefly underwater to appear under greater duress.[14] This episode began the resolution of the story arc about Desmond's prophecy regarding Charlie's inevitable death, which began earlier in the season[15] and would ultimately end in the finale.[16] The storyline was conceived while producing the latter part of the second season when the writers were brainstorming ideas for a new storyline for Charlie. While Desmond could have had flashes of the future about anyone,[17] Charlie was chosen over a less significant character so the story would have higher stakes.[18] Additionally, the writers decided it would be a great way to bring out the heroic side of Charlie, with Charlie being the only character to die willingly.[19] Despite the problems in Charlie's life, the writers believed that Charlie always was a good person and wanted to show that with the happiest moments of the character's life.[14] Monaghan thought that ""Greatest Hits"" was made ""to allow the audience to sit with [his character's fate] long enough to prepare themselves for what was going to happen [in the finale]"".[20] ""Greatest Hits"" marked the first appearance for married couple Rose and Bernard since the late second season[21] and fans welcomed the recurring characters' return.[22] The writers cited the actors' other projects as a reason for their absence. Additionally, it was feared that fans would complain if they appeared,[23] when many actors with star billing had received limited screentime in the early third season.[24] The writers also commented that they do not want to have the couple on the show if they are just going to be standing in the background; they want to have Rose and Bernard in the show with interesting storylines.[25] ""Greatest Hits"" brought in an average of 12.32 million American viewers, making Lost the fifteenth most watched series of the week;[26] this was consistent with previous Lost episodes in the same timeslot.[27] The first half was viewed by 11.9 million, and the audience increased to 12.8 million in the second half.[28] The episode received a 5.2/14 in the key adults 18–49 demographic, placing it as the top-rated scripted program for the night. In Canada, ""Greatest Hits"" was seen by 875,000 people, ranking twenty-seventh for the week.[29] In the United Kingdom, the episode attracted 1.21 million viewers, and was the second most watched program of the week on the non-terrestrial channels, beaten only by Katie & Peter: The Next Chapter.[30] In Australia, Lost was the fifty-first most viewed show of the week, bringing in 1.001 million viewers.[31] Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times thought that ""as far as penultimate set-up-to-the-big-finale episodes go, 'Greatest Hits' was above par in more than one way."" Day celebrated the return of Jack ""from Mt. Boring"", the use of drums in Michael Giacchino's musical score and the return of Rose and Bernard.[32] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Monaghan ""turned in his best performance yet on Lost""[33] and described the final scene as ""breathtaking""[34] with ""a stunningly realized, Emmy-worthy triumph of F/X.""[35]Kristin Veitch of E! also enjoyed Monaghan's acting and called the episode a ""perfect example"" of the series' high quality.[36] Charlie McCollum of the San Jose Mercury News described the latter episodes of the third season as ""an absolute thrill ride"".[37] Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode as an 8.5/10, commending the character development of Jack and Charlie, and the acting skills of Emerson, who portrays Ben.[38] Lulu Bates of Television Without Pity graded the episode as an ""A–"".[39] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad rated ""Greatest Hits"" as a 6/7, saying that it succeeded in building momentum for the season finale, but pointed out the plot inconsistency regarding Charlie's (in)ability to swim.[40] Scott Juba of The Trades decided ""Greatest Hits"" was the best episode of the third season, saying that the flashbacks ""evok[e] the type of identifiable human emotions that drives the success of Lost. The true genius of the show lies not in its plot twists or mysteries but rather in its ability to make the audience invested in the characters by evoking themes that almost anyone can identify with.""[41] Jon Lachonis of BuddyTV noted that the episode was ""wildly successful"" in turning Charlie into a likeable and relatable character.[42] This episode was submitted for consideration for Outstanding Directing[43] and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series[44] for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards. This episode was nominated for the Golden Reel Award in the Best Sound Editing in Television: Short Form – Dialogue and Automated Dialogue Replacement category.[45]",5865,9.2
Through the Looking Glass,3,22,Jack Bender,Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof,Jack,2007-05-23,13.860000000000001,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking_Glass_(Lost),"""Through the Looking Glass"" is the third-season finale of the ABC television series Lost, consisting of the 22nd and 23rd episodes of the third season. It is also the 71st and 72nd episodes overall. It was written by co-creator/executive producer Damon Lindelof and executive producer Carlton Cuse, and directed by executive producer Jack Bender. When first aired on May 23, 2007, in the United States and Canada, it was watched by an average of 14 million American viewers. Like the previous two season finales, it was two hours long with advertisements, twice the length of a normal episode. It was edited into two individual episodes when released on DVD. The season finale is considered by some to be one of the best episodes of television ever broadcast. The episode garnered a number of awards and nominations, including three Primetime Emmy Awards nominations and a Directors Guild of America Award nomination. The episode begins its narrative in late December 2004, over ninety days after the crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. The battle between the crash survivors and the dangerous and mysterious island inhabitants referred to as the ""Others"" comes to a head as ten of the Others attack and are then ambushed at the survivors' camp and are subsequently killed. Meanwhile, Jack Shephard (played by Matthew Fox) leads most of the survivors to the island's radio tower to communicate with a nearby ship. Intercut with this story are off-island scenes spotlighting Jack, who has become suicidally depressed and addicted to painkillers. Jack is shown to be depressed, bearded, heavily drinking and addicted to oxycodone. After reading about the death of someone he knew, Jack appears to be ready to commit suicide by jumping off the Sixth Street Viaduct bridge. However, a fiery car crash occurs on the bridge before he jumps and he goes to the victims; it is eventually revealed that the driver crashed after being distracted by Jack. Later, Jack visits the memorial service for the person he read about and finds himself to be the only attendee. In the last of the flashes, Kate appears and Jack discusses the island with her. In a twist ending, it becomes clear that the sequences are actually flashforwards rather than flashbacks.[2] Jack tells Kate about the memorial service but Kate, acting distant toward him, coldly retorts that she would not have gone had she known. Jack also talks about using the ""golden pass"" they had received from Oceanic Airlines to fly back and forth across the Pacific Ocean every Friday, hoping that he will crash in the island. Jack laments about having to lie and that they should never have left. However, Kate disagrees and leaves while Jack cries out that they have to go back.[3] The Others intend to attack the camp and kidnap pregnant women for scientific research.[4] The survivors are tipped off by the ""Other"" Karl (Blake Bashoff) and plan to kill the Others with dynamite-rigged tents.[5]Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), and Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) remain at the beach, tasked with shooting the tents while the rest of the survivors journey with Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) to the radio tower to communicate with Naomi Dorrit's (Marsha Thomason) nearby ship. The Others arrive, and while Sayid and Bernard detonate their tents, Jin misses his target, which results in their capture.[6] After hearing only two explosions, James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) turn back to see if they can help. Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), who was not allowed to accompany Sawyer and Juliet because of his weight, drives the van he found onto the beach,[7] and the captives gain the upper hand, killing the remaining Others with the help of Sawyer and Juliet.[8]Tom (M.C. Gainey) surrenders but Sawyer shoots him anyway. In The Looking Glass, a research station of the Dharma Initiative, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) is captured by the resident Others Greta (Lana Parrilla) and Bonnie (Tracy Middendorf). Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) learns of Charlie's infiltration and sends Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff) to the station to kill the three to preserve the signal jamming. Mikhail arrives and kills Greta and Bonnie, only to be shot through the chest with a spear gun by Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) who emerges from a closet where he had hidden after diving down a short time after Charlie. Getting the code from Bonnie before she dies (the notes to the middle eight of ""Good Vibrations"" by The Beach Boys), Charlie disables the jammer, and is contacted by Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger) via video transmission. Penny informs Charlie that she does not know Naomi, and did not send the boat that Naomi claims to be from. Despite his injury, Mikhail manages to swim out of the station and blasts the window of the jamming room with a grenade, killing himself and flooding the communications room.[9] Charlie locks the door to save Desmond from drowning with him, but before he drowns, Charlie writes on his hand so Desmond can read: ""NOT PENNY'S BOAT"".[8] John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), one of the survivors, has been shot by Ben.[10] Finding his legs paralyzed again, Locke is about to commit suicide, when he is stopped by what appears to be Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley). Walt tells John that he has the use of his legs and that he has ""work to do"". Meanwhile, Ben tells Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) to lead the rest of the Others to the ""Temple"" and then leaves the Others, with his adopted daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde) – Rousseau's daughter and Karl's girlfriend[11] – to meet up with the survivors to persuade Jack not to call Naomi's ship for rescue.[12] Kate is upset about Sawyer not wanting her to come back to the beach with him to rescue Sayid, Jin and Bernard. Jack tells her it is because Sawyer was trying to protect her. When she asks why Jack is defending Sawyer, Jack informs Kate that it is because he loves her. Kate also witnessed a kiss between him and Juliet. Ben and Alex intercept Jack's group; Ben informs Jack that Naomi is not who she says she is, and making contact with her boat will be disastrous for everyone. Ben orders the shooting of Sayid, Jin, and Bernard, and when Jack hears three shots, he attacks Ben and punches him in the face repeatedly. Unknown to Jack, the shots were fired into the sand, following earlier orders from Ben. Rousseau meets her sixteen-year-old daughter Alex, who was kidnapped by the Others shortly after her birth,[13] and they tie Ben up. The trek party, now able to get a signal, arrives at the radio tower. Rousseau disables her distress signal, freeing the frequency for Naomi. However, Naomi is knifed in the back by Locke, who threatens to kill Jack if he calls Naomi's boat. Locke cannot bring himself to kill Jack, who communicates with George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) on Naomi's boat. Minkowski tells the survivors they will be sending rescue.[8] The episode's title is an allusion to Lewis Carroll's novel Through the Looking-Glass[14] and a reference to the fictitious Dharma Initiative station featured in the previous episode. Shooting began on April 13, 2007[15] and ended on May 7, 2007.[16] The writers were so far behind schedule that parts of the episode were shot while later parts were still being written.[17] Filming mostly took place on Oahu, Hawaii, with additional scenes shot in Los Angeles.[18] The hospital scenes were filmed on the same sets used for the ABC show Grey's Anatomy.[19] Despite not being mentioned in the official press release,[20] then-15-year-old Malcolm David Kelley, who was a main cast member in Season 1, returned to reprise his role as 10-year-old Walt Lloyd,[21] and received credit as a ""special guest star"".[22] Kelley's character had left the island in the second-season finale,[23] only 26 days prior to the events of ""Through the Looking Glass""; however, Kelley had not filmed an episode in over a year. In his single scene, Walt has visibly aged, appears taller and has a deeper voice.[24] The producers had hoped that Harold Perrineau, who plays Walt's father Michael Dawson, would return in this episode, but he was busy filming the pilot for CBS' Demons.[25] Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse lent their voices for the unseen roles of the flight captain and newscaster, respectively.[26] This episode concluded the story arc about Charlie's death, which began earlier in the season when Desmond prophesied Charlie's death.[27] Throughout the season, Charlie escaped death;[28] however, Desmond told Charlie that he had to die in order for his girlfriend, Claire Littleton, to get rescued from the island.[5] The storyline of Charlie's death was conceived while producing the latter part of the second season,[29] after the storyline of Charlie's drug addiction finished.[30] The news of his character's death was broken to Monaghan two episodes in advance,[31] to which Monaghan felt ""relief"" for knowing the future of his job on the show.[32] On the night of Monaghan's second-to-last day on set, he was presented with a canoe paddle that had been made by the cast and crew.[33] Monaghan hoped to return to Lost as a guest star in flashbacks or dreams.[34] Jack Bender stated that Matthew Fox ""really commits body and soul into the story he's telling"" and Fox questioned whether he had ever been more tired than while shooting the double episode.[35] Like the other Lost season finales, the final cliffhanger scene was given a codename—""The Rattlesnake in the Mailbox""—and kept top secret.[36] After Lindelof and Cuse wrote the scene, only Fox, Lilly, Bender, and co-executive producer Jean Higgins were given copies of the script. The scene was shot with a green screen in an abandoned Honolulu parking lot with the airport edited in.[37] Despite the security measures, a complete and detailed episode synopsis was uploaded online over a week before the episode aired.[38]Disney investigated the leak.[39] The leak prompted Lindelof and Cuse to enter ""radio silence"", which was temporarily broken at Comic-Con International 2007.[40] The funeral parlor that Jack visits is called ""Hoffs/Drawlar"", which is an anagram of ""flashforward"".[41] The idea of flashforwards was conceived by creators Lindelof and Abrams during the show's conception.[42] However, Cuse and Lindelof only started fleshing out the idea at the end of the first season, after they realized that flashbacks would eventually stop being revelatory and knew that they would eventually have to switch to flashforwards.[43] With the announcement that the series would conclude 48 episodes after ""Through the Looking Glass"",[44] they felt comfortable playing flashforwards as early as the third-season finale. Post-production wrapped on May 21, 2007, only two days before it aired on television.[14] The score was composed by series musician Michael Giacchino, while popular music was also featured throughout the episode.[45] Charlie also sings a song in the episode that was written by Dominic Monaghan, who plays him.[46] A Lost season finale is approximately twice as long as the average Lost episode. Due to the episode's length, it was split into two parts in some countries and when released on DVD.[47] Unlike most episodes, this episode did not feature a ""previously on Lost…"" recap at the start of the episode when it first aired; however, it was originally preceded by a clip-show titled ""Lost: The Answers"", which recapped the third season.[48] Cuse said that he and Lindelof think the finale is ""very cool [and] we're very proud of it.""[14] Stephen McPherson, the president of ABC Entertainment, called ""Through the Looking Glass"" ""one of the best episodes"" of the series.[49]Buena Vista Home Entertainment released ""Through the Looking Glass"" on the season's DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets on December 11, 2007 in Region 1.[50] A featurette called ""Lost: On Location"" features cast and crew discussing production of select episodes, including ""Through the Looking Glass"". The episode was rerun for the first time on January 30, 2008 with on-screen text in the lower third of the screen, similar to VH1's Pop-up Video.[51] These pop-ups were not written by Lost's writers due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike; they were written by the marketing company Met/Hodder.[52] This enhanced edition was viewed by almost 9 million Americans.[53] In the U.S., the episode brought in the best ratings for Lost in fifteen episodes.[54] The two-hour Wednesday broadcast on ABC made Lost the fourth most watched series of the week with an average of 13.86 million American viewers,[55] below the third season average of 14.6 million.[56] The first hour was viewed by 12.67 million, and the audience increased to 15.04 million in the second hour. The episode received a 5.9/15 in the key adults 18–49 demographic.[57] In the United Kingdom, the episode attracted 1.21 million viewers, and was the second most watched program of the week on the non-terrestrial channels, beaten only by Katie & Peter: The Next Chapter.[58] In Australia, Lost was the thirty-seventh most viewed show of the week, bringing in 1.17 million viewers.[59] In Canada, the episode placed sixteenth for the first half, with 911,000 viewers and fifteenth for the second half, with 938,000 viewers. The episodes were broadcast before and after American Idol.[60] The episode garnered universal critical acclaim.[62] The Los Angeles Times wrote that the episode was ""an unusually action-packed and sanguinary spring cleaning that… left a host of… characters… dead"",[63]Access Atlanta said ""it was deeply satisfying. The first hour started a bit slow but the second hour had great twists, wonderfully emotional moments, both happy and sad"",[64] and the Associated Press said that ""the powerful season-ending episode redeemed the series with the shrewdness and intrigue that made it so addictive in the first place.""[65] The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that ""not only was the pace fast, the teases taut, and the answers plenty, the writers took a compelling gamble… [by telling] viewers that in the future… maybe all… of the people on the Lost island get off. They get their wish. But in Jack, our guide through this series, the writers definitively say, 'Be careful what you wish for.'""[66] The San Jose Mercury News called the finale a ""jaw-dropping exercise in good storytelling.""[67] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette commented that the flashforward ""twist gave the saga renewed momentum as it begins its march toward a 2010 finish.""[68] The season finale was summed up as ""a mind-blower, for sure, a radical two hours that gave us major fake-outs, an army of dead bodies, the possibility of rescue [and] diverse portraits of heroism"" by The Boston Globe, who added that the death of Charlie was ""the most touching loss of the series so far.""[69]The Palm Beach Post[70] and Wizard named it the ""Best Cliffhanger"" of 2007.[71] The Chicago Tribune called it ""a qualified success"" with excellent pacing and action, however, the flashforward scenes were thought to be uninteresting and ""clumsy"".[72]Time ranked the episode as the best of 2007[73] and the ""Rattlesnake in the Mailbox"" as one of the ten best scenes of 2007 television.[74] The Futon Critic placed the episode first in the site's annual ""50 Best Episodes"" list.[75]E! said that ""Through the Looking Glass"" was possibly ""the best episode ever of the entire series.""[42]TV Guide described ""Through the Looking Glass"" as ""a dizzying exercise in adventure, sustained tension and time-shifting rug pulling [that was] spectacularly produced, amazingly directed and gloriously acted.""[76]IGN gave the double episode a perfect 10/10[77] – the best review of the season – saying it was ""nothing short of a masterpiece of storytelling with a brilliantly paced narrative.""[78]IGN would conclude that the flashforward was the ""Biggest Shock"" in 2007 television.[79] Both IGN and The Los Angeles Times would later declare ""Through the Looking Glass"" as the second best Lost episode, behind ""The Constant"".[80][81]BuddyTV praised the unpredictability, saying that ""no other show can even attempt to do what Lost does.""[61]BuddyTV would later call ""Through the Looking Glass"" the best finale of 2007[82] and Charlie's death the saddest TV death of 2007.[83] ""Through the Looking Glass"" was TV.com's ""Editor's Choice"" for ""Best Episode"" of 2007.[84]AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a 7/7, noting that ""the writers followed through on Desmond's premonitions and successfully delivered the highly anticipated game-changer.""[85]Television Without Pity gave the third-season finale an ""A"".[86]The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that Lost ""may have unjumped [the shark] with [the] flashforward.""[87]Entertainment Weekly ranked it as one of the top ten episodes of 2007,[88] saying that the cliffhanger ""[revealed] new dimensions to [Lost's] creative world.""[89]Zap2It questioned ""whether to be deeply frustrated (again), really, really confused (a distinct possibility) or just in awe of the incredible mind-(ahem) show runners… have pulled off.""[90] The writing for Locke was criticized, and one IGN writer said that ""it seems irrational that he would go and [stab Naomi] in the back without explaining himself.""[91] Lindelof stated ""that we might be willing to give [Locke] the benefit of the doubt for any action he took in response to [lying, gutshot, in a pit of Dharma corpses for two days and on the verge of taking his own life], even if considered slightly 'out of character'.""[92] Film and television director and writer Kevin Smith said that ""to do [3] seasons and then suddenly throw a massive curveball is just so dramatically satisfying, you just take your hats off to the writers in a big, bad way.""[93] This episode was nominated for Outstanding Directing, Outstanding Writing, and Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards,[94] but failed to win in any of the categories.[95] This episode was also submitted for consideration for Outstanding Drama Series;[96] however, it was not nominated.[97] For his work on this episode, Jack Bender was nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Drama Series.[98]",10998,9.7
The Beginning of the End,4,1,Jack Bender,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,Hurley,2008-01-31,16.07,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_the_End_(Lost),"""The Beginning of the End"" is the fourth season premiere, and 73rd episode overall, of the American Broadcasting Company's television drama series Lost. It was aired on ABC in the United States and CTV in Canada on January 31, 2008.[2] Co-creator/executive producer Damon Lindelof and executive producer Carlton Cuse wrote the premiere in late July 2007,[3] with most of the episode directed on location in Oahu, Hawaii, in August and September by executive producer Jack Bender.[4] With this premiere, Jeff Pinkner no longer serves as an executive producer and staff writer.[5] The episode was watched by 18 million Americans, bringing in the best ratings for Lost in 17 episodes.[6] According to Metacritic, ""The Beginning of the End"" garnered ""universal acclaim"".[7] The narrative takes place over 90 days after the crash of Oceanic Flight 815, on December 23, 2004. The stranded crash survivors make contact with associates of Naomi Dorrit (played by Marsha Thomason) on a nearby freighter, but the survivors divide when they hear that those on the freighter may not be coming to rescue the survivors. Flashforwards show the post-island lives of Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). They are lying to the public about their time on the island. In flashforwards, Hurley has visions of his deceased friend Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan); in the present, Hurley grieves over Charlie's death on the island. Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) makes his first appearance in ""The Beginning of the End"".[4] After being knifed in the back by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) in the third-season finale, Naomi uses her satellite phone to call George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) on the freighter. Before she dies, she tells him that her injury was an accident and to give her love to her sister. Meanwhile, Hurley finds Jacob's cabin. He looks through the window and sees an unidentified man in a rocking chair, before someone steps up to the glass, only the left eye visible. Hurley runs away, but finds the cabin again—in a different location. He squeezes his eyes shut and when he opens them, the building is gone and Locke appears. Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) returns from the Looking Glass, bearing Charlie's final message that the freighter offshore is not owned by Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger). The survivors reunite at 815's cockpit. Jack knocks Locke to the ground, takes his gun and pulls the trigger, but finds that the gun is not loaded because Locke had no intention of killing Jack earlier that day. Locke tells the castaways that they are in great danger and leaves for the Barracks with Hurley, James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) and her baby Aaron, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) and her captive Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), Alex (Tania Raymonde) and her boyfriend Karl (Blake Bashoff), Vincent the dog (Pono)[8] and four other survivors. Soon after, Jack and Kate see a helicopter and meet Daniel.[9] Flashforwards show that Hurley is famous as one of the ""Oceanic Six"" after his escape from the island and is keeping quiet about his time there. Hurley encounters an apparition of Charlie. Shocked, he speeds away in his Camaro and is apprehended by Los Angeles police. Hurley is interrogated by Ana Lucia Cortez's (Michelle Rodriguez) former partner Detective ""Big"" Mike Walton (Michael Cudlitz) and he lies that he has no knowledge of Ana Lucia. Hurley, looking at the interrogation room's mirror glass, imagines seeing Charlie swimming in water until he breaks the glass and floods the room. Hurley willingly returns to the Santa Rosa Mental Health Institution, where he is visited by Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick), who claims to be an attorney for Oceanic Airlines. When Abaddon fails to supply a business card, he asks if they are still alive before stealthily exiting. An apparition of Charlie appears who tells Hurley that ""they"" need him. Finally, Hurley is visited by Jack, who is thinking of growing a beard. Jack confirms that Hurley will not reveal the Oceanic Six's secrets. Hurley apologizes for going with Locke and insists that they return to the island, but Jack refuses (which shows that these flashforwards occur before Jack's flashforwards). During casting, fake names, occupations and scenes were temporarily assigned to limit the leak of spoilers.[10]Lance Reddick was told that he was auditioning for the part of ""Arthur Stevens"", a ""ruthless corporate recruiter"", instead of Matthew Abaddon. ""Matthew"" and ""Abaddon"" were revealed as season 4 clue words in the alternate reality game Find 815.[11] The writers chose the character's surname after they read the Wikipedia article on Abaddon, which states that it means ""place of destruction"".[12] The writer-producers were originally interested in having Reddick play Mr. Eko during the second season, however, he was busy starring on HBO's The Wire.[13]Jeremy Davies was cast as Daniel because he is one of the writer-producers' favorite character actors, and they think that his ""transformative quality [and] the tremendous intelligence that seems to emanate from him ... seemed perfect for [the part]"",[14] which was originally planned to be a recurring role.[15] When Davies met costume designer Roland Sanchez, he was wearing a thin black tie. Sanchez merged this ""cool, edgy look"" with his idea for the character's clothes: a ""nerdy"" loosely woven dress shirt from J.Crew.[16] Several different titles were proposed for the episode.[3] The ultimate title is a reference to a line in the previous episode when Ben warns Jack that contacting the freighter ""is the beginning of the end"".[17] Filming began on August 17[18] and ended on or just after September 7, 2007.[19] Garcia felt ""a little pressure"" because he had the lead role in the episode, but ""was really excited, too [because it] was a different direction for a season premiere [that he] felt the fans would probably dig"".[20] In the mental institution, Hurley is seen painting a picture of an Inuit man and an igloo. This was painted by Garcia.[21] When the episode was broadcast, Christian appeared in Jacob's cabin; however, the scene was shot with another Hurley inside. Additionally, when Garcia was filming his interrogation scene in an aquarium, he was unaware that Charlie would be swimming outside and breaking the glass in the finished product.[22] Charlie's swim was filmed weeks after the rest of the episode had been shot, alongside production of ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" and the Lost: Missing Pieces mobisodes in late November 2007. The scene was filmed with stunt double Jake Kilfoyle at the Looking Glass set that was previously used for the third season episodes titled ""Greatest Hits"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"".[23] Most Lost episodes feature crossovers and ""Easter eggs""—intentionally hidden clues and references to the show's mythology[24]—and ""The Beginning of the End"" is no exception.[25] Despite being dead, Christian appears for a couple of seconds in Jacob's cabin with no dialogue.[26] Big Mike, who appears in Ana Lucia's flashbacks in the second-season episode ""Collision"", returns in Hurley's flashforward. Randy Nations (Billy Ray Gallion) appears in a few seconds with no dialogue, videotaping Hurley's arrest.[27] When Hurley hallucinates that Charlie is swimming outside the interrogation room, Charlie has ""they need you"" written on his hand. This is what Charlie tells Hurley later in the episode.[28] Due to production of the fourth season being put on hold due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike,[29] the show runners wanted to hold the eight episodes that had been completed until they were able to make more of the season.[30] ABC decided against this and announced that ""The Beginning of the End"" would be aired at the end of January 2008, regardless of when the strike was to end.[31] This was the first Lost episode to be aired on Thursday at 9:00 pm ET,[32] a competitive and prestigious timeslot[33] normally occupied by Grey's Anatomy;[34] previous episodes had been aired on Wednesdays.[35] Like the previous Lost season premieres, ""The Beginning of the End"" was scheduled for an outdoor premiere at Sunset on the Beach in Waikiki, Honolulu,[36] where movies are regularly shown on a 30-foot (9 m) screen free to the public,[37] but it was cancelled due to the writers' strike.[38] The original television broadcast of the episode was immediately preceded by a clip-show titled ""Lost: Past, Present & Future"".[39] Don Williams of BuddyTV dubbed ""The Beginning of the End"" ""the most anticipated season premiere of the year"".[40] It was watched by approximately 16.137 million American viewers live or within six hours with a 6.7/17 in the key adults 18–49 demographic,[41] bringing in the best Nielsen ratings for Lost in seventeen episodes and ranking Lost eighth in the weekly charts.[42] The episode was watched by a total of 17.766 million viewers live or recorded and watched within seven days of broadcast and this number went toward the year-end average.[43] In Canada, ""The Beginning of the End"" was seen by 1.855 million viewers, making Lost the sixth most watched program of the week.[44] It brought in an audience almost double the size of that of the previous episode and greater than any third-season episode,[45] with the exception of the season premiere.[46] The fourth-season premiere was successful in the United Kingdom with 1.1 million viewers.[47] In Australia, Lost was the fifteenth most watched show of the night with 912 000 viewers, which was deemed disappointing by David Dale of The Sun-Herald.[48] American critics were sent screener DVDs of ""The Beginning of the End"" and ""Confirmed Dead"" on January 28, 2008. Metacritic gave the episode a Metascore—a weighted average based on the impressions of a select twelve critical reviews—of 87.[7] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that ""returning with a heart-stopping, perfectly pitched episode ... Lost is an oasis in a strike-parched TV desert.""[49] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times described ""The Beginning of the End"" as an ""emotion-churning chemical dump right in the old brain stem—horror, hysteria, regret, adrenaline and what ... will happen next?""[50] Adam Buckman of the New York Post gave the episode four out of four stars.[51] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune ""blissfully enjoyed every minute"" and noted that ""there aren't any faults"".[52] Diane Werts of Newsday raved the episode as ""superb"" and ""insanely entertain[ing]"" and concluded her review with ""Lost seems to have found itself"".[53] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle declared that it and ""Confirmed Dead"" ""are roller coasters of fast action and revelation [that are] good to see"".[54] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe pointed out that ""Lost can still make the pulse race and the brain tingle ... [and] remains TV's most gripping serial"".[55] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger was unsure ""if Lost is ever going to give satisfying answers to its many, many remaining mysteries ... but when it's as scary and hilarious and moving and exciting as these two episodes, I'm okay with that.""[56] In less positive reviews, Rodney Ho of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called it ""a satisfactory return episode with a fair share of drama and pathos ... [that] provides just enough revelations to keep fans hungry for more""[57] and David Hinckley of the Daily News rated the episode with three stars out of a possible five.[58] Brian Lowry of Variety said that ""Lost's return goes down like a welcome tonic as scripted TV fades to black ... providing an unusually generous array of juicy moments for the large (and, at times, neglected) cast.""[59] Mark Medley of the National Post called it ""a brilliant season premiere"" with multiple ""jaw-dropping moments"".[60] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly felt that the premiere was mind-blowing[61] and featured good acting by Garcia.[20] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press wrote that ""Lost is further upping the ante, and heightening the pressure on us as the show's vast mythology continues to metastasize.""[62]Kristin Dos Santos of E! called it ""so well written, produced, acted and directed it felt like a movie"".[63]Michael Ausiello of TV Guide described it as ""easily one of the best hours of TV so far this season.""[64] Bruce Fretts of TV Guide responded well to Reddick's performance.[65] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode 9.1/10, stating that it was ""a great start to what promises to be an exciting ... season 4. The momentum and pacing is on par with last season's finale"".[66] LTG of Television Without Pity graded it as an ""A–"".[67] Jon Lachonis of UGO gave the episode an ""A+"", calling it ""a crushingly emotional, action packed introduction ... [which proves] that ... Lost's groundbreaking protean form still has plenty of blinding ways to dazzle and entertain in a way that is nonetheless unique unto itself.""[68] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV wrote that ""the episode was pretty much a masterpiece"".[69] Daniel of TMZ graded it as an ""A"", saying that it was perfect and set up the rest of the season well.[70]",5868,8.8
Confirmed Dead,4,2,Stephen Williams,Drew Goddard & Brian K. Vaughan,Faraday & Charlotte & Miles & Frank,2008-02-07,15.06,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmed_Dead,"""Confirmed Dead"" is the second episode of the fourth season of ABC's serial television drama Lost and the 74th episode overall. It was first aired on February 7, 2008, on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada.[2] The episode includes the first appearances of the main characters Miles Straume and Charlotte Lewis and the supporting character Frank Lapidus. Ken Leung played Miles Straume, Rebecca Mader played Charlotte Lewis and Jeff Fahey played Frank Lapidus. The actors were given fake scenes when auditioning to limit the leak of story information or spoilers. Mader and Fahey were different from the writers' visions of Charlotte and Frank, but the writers changed the characters to suit them. Also, the role of Miles was changed for Leung. The episode was written by co-executive producer Drew Goddard and co-producer Brian K. Vaughan and directed by co-executive producer Stephen Williams.[3] The beginning of the episode is set on December 21, 2004, or 91 days after the original characters crash-land on a tropical island from Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. During the show, flashbacks introduce the island's latest arrivals – four people from an offshore freighter who landed on the island. The main action is of John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) leading his group to the Barracks. He begins to find out why Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) is afraid of the newcomers. ""Confirmed Dead"" was watched by 17 million Americans and received generally positive critical reception as reviewers praised the introduction of the new characters.[4] The episode's five flashbacks focus on the reactions and activities of the freighter's crew who made contact with the Oceanic 815 survivors; Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) is shown crying while watching a newscast confirming the deaths of all Oceanic 815 passengers. His caretaker asks why he is crying, and he answers that he does not know. Miles Straume (Ken Leung) is a medium hired by an elderly woman to remove the ghost of her grandson from her home. After conversing with the spirit, Miles finds a hidden cache of money and drugs. Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) is an anthropologist who finds a polar bear skeleton bearing a Dharma Initiative collar buried in the Tunisian desert. Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) is an alcoholic who was originally scheduled to pilot flight 815. He phones the Oceanic hotline while watching the newscast and claims that the footage of the plane wreckage being aired on television is not authentic, while Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) is shown in a posthumous flashback, criticizing her employer Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick) for his choice in her coworkers. After Daniel parachutes from a failing helicopter onto the island, he uses Naomi's phone to contact George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) on the ship that he came from.[5] The next morning, on December 22, 2004, two of the flight 815 survivors – Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) – help Daniel find his colleagues, as the rival group led by Locke attempts to do the same. Jack and Kate find Miles, who demands to see Naomi's body, and reasons that Naomi was killed by Kate as Naomi said a code on the phone before dying. Kate confesses then that Naomi was killed by John Locke. Locke's group finds Charlotte, takes her prisoner, and disposes of her tracking device. Daniel's third colleague, helicopter pilot Frank, fires a flare into the sky, leading Jack's group to him. Frank tells Jack's group that he managed to land the helicopter intact. After finding out that Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) is one of the Others, Miles demands to know where Ben (Michael Emerson) is, as locating him is the freighter crew's primary objective. In Locke's group, several people become discontent with Locke's revelation that he is following the instructions of Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), who had left the island a month earlier,[6] and they also question why Ben is being kept alive. Locke holds him at gunpoint, and Ben starts to reveal information about the Kahana crew, specifically Charlotte's identity and that he has a spy aboard the ship. While casting the ""freighter folk"" – the nickname that Lost's executive producers/writers/show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse use to refer to Daniel, Charlotte, Miles and Frank[7] – fake names, occupations and scenes were temporarily assigned, to limit the leak of spoilers.[8] After seeing Ken Leung guest star on HBO's The Sopranos in April 2007, Lindelof and Cuse wrote the role of Miles specifically for him,[9] although it was initially reported that Leung would be playing the part of ""brilliant mathematician"" ""Russell"".[10] The name Miles Straume was simply chosen because the writer-producers thought that ""it would be cool if his name sounded like 'maelstrom'"".[7] Had he not taken the part, Lindelof and Cuse claim that Miles would have been scrapped and a new and very different character would have been written into the story instead. Leung, who was originally contracted as a recurring guest star, was quoted as saying that ""Miles doesn't know how to be social, which is great, because I don't know how to be social.""[11] Costume designer Roland Sanchez wanted to base one of the freighter folk's clothing after that of Keith Richards, specifically a picture in which he wore a sleeveless vest, which he admired. Sanchez believed that Miles fitted the haggard look and bought an Armani Exchange jacket, cut off the sleeves and added a hood, and that this outfit helped Leung to develop Miles.[12] Co-executive producer/writer Edward Kitsis had been pitching the name ""Lapidus"" for years, finally naming an unseen character in the fourteenth episode of the third season Rick Lapidus.[13] Unsatisfied, Kitsis developed the character ""Frank Lapidus, Helicopter Pilot"".[7] According to the show runners, recurring guest star Jeff Fahey ""was the first and only choice for the role"". They also commended his ""intense eyes"" and stated that ""he has exactly the right sensibilities"" for the part.[14] Frank was not envisioned with a beard, however, the writer-producers allowed Fahey to keep it for the role. The writer-producers have said that Frank ""never takes anything at face value [and is] a true conspiracy nut [who] has probably seen every episode of The X-Files, [which will] pay off for him"".[15] Rebecca Mader's audition scene was a fake flashback and she was disappointed that it was not used for the show.[16] The character's name was spoiled months in advance of broadcast. Charlotte was originally envisioned as an American;[17] however, the writers preferred Mader's natural English accent to her fake American accent and they changed Charlotte accordingly. Lost's writer-producers compared Mader to ""a young Nicole Kidman"".[18] During the casting process, Charlotte was described as a ""successful academic"".[19] It was falsely rumored that Kristen Bell was offered the role of Charlotte;[20] Bell had actually spoken to the producers about having a part; however, no role was offered to her.[21] Despite never having seen Lost, Mader decided that she ""was not going to leave [the auditioning] room until [she] made [Lindelof and Cuse] fall in love with [her]"".[22] Mader subsequently began to watch the first three seasons of Lost and was watching the fourth episode when she received the news that she had been chosen for the role.[23] In the next two to three weeks, Mader – who was then signed on as a recurring guest star – watched the rest of the first three seasons, watching the third-season finale a matter of hours before she began shooting her first ""Confirmed Dead"" scene, in which Charlotte meets Locke and his group. Mader was told little about her character by the writer-producers, except that ""she was sort of like a female Indiana Jones type"". Mader has found it challenging but fun to play a character with an unknown backstory and motives. Charlotte's full name is Charlotte Staples Lewis, which is an homage to the author C.S. Lewis, best known for The Chronicles of Narnia and various books about Christianity. Lewis was one of Mader's favorite authors as a child and found it ""wicked"" and ""cool"" for her character to be named after him.[24] Mader also enjoyed that she only requires a small amount of hair and makeup done, saying that ""I just wanted to rough it. I wanted to roll around in the mud with a gun.""[25] Mader claims that she has ""never had so much fun in [her] life"" as when she is shooting Lost.[26] In the episode, Charlotte's birthday is said to be July 2, 1979. This led to a minor continuity error in the fifth-season episode ""LaFleur"", when Charlotte is depicted as being a little girl in 1974. Executive producers Cuse and Lindelof claimed in a podcast that the original script for ""Confirmed Dead"" listed Charlotte's birthday as being in 1970 and that Mader had it changed because she did not want people to think she was significantly older than she actually is. This caused a controversy when Mader later stated on her blog that Gregg Nations, the script coordinator, was the one who suggested the change. Cuse and Lindelof later conceded that she was right.[27][28] Most or all of the episode was shot from September 11[29] to 23, 2007[30] and filming overlapped with the following episode.[31] The Tunisian desert scene was filmed on location in Oahu, Hawaii, like the rest of the episode, at a stone quarry with industrial fans blowing fake sand.[23] A typical Lost episode contains fifty visual effects shots. Among scenes created entirely or partially with effects are the opening scene of ""Confirmed Dead"", which shows what appears to be the wreckage of 815 underwater and the scene from Daniel's perspective as he parachutes from the helicopter to the ground. In Frank's flashback, he drops a toy plane, which spirals into a small aquarium. This shot was not intended to use effects; however, ""it's impossible to get a toy plane to spiral the way you want it to"", according to supervisor Mitch Suskin. A tank with still water and rocks on the bottom was filmed and the plane was added in editing. Suskin said that creating effects for ""Confirmed Dead"" ""was slightly too leisurely"" because the episode aired over four months after post-production began.[32] In fall 2007, Lost's writers presented ABC executives with the story that a salvage vessel called the Christiane I looking for the Black Rock, among other things, in the Sunda Trench would come across what would appear to be the wreckage of 815. ABC hired the Australian company Hoodlum to design a $3 million viral marketing alternate reality game (ARG) titled Find 815.[33]Find 815 ran from December 28, 2007 to January 31, 2008, beginning with a press release issued from ABC Medianet announcing the fictitious return of the fictional Oceanic Airlines' return to business.[34] The ARG – apparently the largest ever – followed Sam Thomas, an Oceanic technician who had lost his girlfriend in the crash, as he received cryptic e-mails from The Maxwell Group (a division of Widmore Industries, but nonexistent in Lost), joined the crew of the Christiane I and ultimately uncovered 815.[35] Because Find 815 was produced separately from the show and without the show's writers, it contradicts events in the TV series.[36] In ""Confirmed Dead"", 815 is found by a man not present in the game named Ron; Thomas is not mentioned. Lindelof and Cuse dismissed the game as not being canon (not containing genuine information within the fictional universe) and was largely just a bonus for fans during the between-seasons hiatus.[37] ""Confirmed Dead"" was watched by 15.292 million American viewers live or recorded and watched within six hours of broadcast, ranking Lost seventh in the weekly chart.[38] It was watched by a total of 16.963 million viewers, including those who watched within seven days of broadcast; this number went toward the year-end season average.[39] The episode received a 6.5/16 in the key adults 18–49 demographic.[40] In Canada, it ranked sixth for the week with 1.702 million viewers.[41] In the United Kingdom, Lost was watched by 1.2 million viewers – a larger audience than that of the season premiere.[42] In Australia, ""Confirmed Dead"" brought in 853,000 viewers, ranking seventy-first for the week.[43] American critics were sent screener DVDs of ""The Beginning of the End"" and ""Confirmed Dead"" on January 28, 2008 with instructions not to reveal major plot points in reviews. Among the journalists who gave vague and positive reviews were Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times,[44] Adam Buckman of the New York Post,[45] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune,[46] Diane Werts of Newsday[47] and Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle.[48] According to Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV, ""Confirmed Dead"" ""was met with almost universal love from the Lost fan base""[49] and according to Jon Lachonis of UGO, the new characters were well received by the fan scene.[23] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that ""after an underwhelming pre-credits sequence ... this sucker moved, and lots of things happened. We met our four new regulars, squeezed in useful flashbacks about [them] and even found out the real reason they're on the island ... The flipside of all this business is that 'Confirmed Dead' didn't have the same emotional resonance as '[The] Beginning of the End' ... but you clearly can't have everything in every episode.""[50]Time's James Poniewozik said that ""What amazed [him] about this episode was the economy and precision with which it introduced ... the crew of the downed chopper from [the freighter]. Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet by the end of the episode, I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals.""[51] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly thought that ""Confirmed Dead"" ""was downright alive with fascinating new characters, mind-blowing new possibilities, and exciting new theory fodder""; however, he had heard complaints from others who received the preview screeners that they found the episode to be flawed. They considered the scene where 815 is found to be cheating the flashback formula because Daniel only experiences it by watching it on television, Frank's safe landing of the helicopter to be a mystery, Naomi's flashback to be cheating Lost rules because she is dead and Ben's manipulation of Locke to be an overused storyline.[52]E!'s Kristin Dos Santos exclaimed ""hot damn!"" in response to the scene where 815 is found in the Sunda Trench. She also thought that ""Juliet and Kate giggling at Jack's 'wink thing' was hilarious"" and it was ""awesome to see [the pilot] again"".[53] Nikki Stafford of Wizard highlighted ""watching Dan's landing from his point of view. You can feel his panic as he's free-falling through the air, looks up at his parachute, looks down to see himself about to hit the trees ... it was amazing.""[54]IGN's Chris Carabott gave ""Confirmed Dead"" an 8/10, writing that it ""isn't a disappointing episode by any means but it definitely suffers from being a 'setup' episode for these four new characters"" and praising the new actors by writing that ""Leung does an adequate job of getting Miles' arrogant brand of confidence across while Davies presents Faraday's awkward mannerisms well. Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent.""[55] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad said that ""Watching 'Confirmed Dead' was like watching my dream episode of Lost [because] people asked direct questions for once ... [and] this episode was all about the Freighties.""[56] A day after the original broadcast, BuddyTV's Dahl claimed that ""[the audience is] on an epic journey, one that has been as entertaining and engrossing as any TV series has ever been"".[57] In contrast, TV Guide's Michael Ausiello of said that it ""was thirty-one flavors of awesome ... [however] the negatives outweighed the positives"". He had problems with Claire's lack of grief for Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) death and Jack waiting so long to find out the freighter folk's main objective.[58] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave ""Confirmed Dead"" three out of five stars, calling it ""so-so"", but commenting that ""the new revelations in the episode are fairly startling and provide a momentary distraction from the frustrations.""[59]",4880,8.7
The Economist,4,3,Jack Bender,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Sayid,2008-02-14,13.62,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist_(Lost),"""The Economist"" is the third episode of the fourth season and 75th episode overall of the ABC's serial drama television series Lost. It was aired on February 14, 2008, on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada.[2] The episode was written by co-executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by executive producer Jack Bender.[3] In the episode's narrative, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) negotiate for John Locke's (Terry O'Quinn) hostage Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader), while physicist and Kahana crew member Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) discovers that time on the island runs at an offset from the rest of the world. Another storyline follows Sayid working as an assassin after being rescued from the island. ""The Economist"" was watched by 14 million American viewers and received positive reactions from critics. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Miles Straume (Ken Leung) argue about what to do about leader of the Others, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), and Miles's colleague Charlotte, both sought after by Miles and his colleagues and taken prisoner by Locke. Sayid pays his respects to Naomi Dorrit, and takes her bracelet. He then offers to retrieve Charlotte without bloodshed, in return gaining a helicopter flight to the freighter anchored offshore. He takes along Miles and Kate. Sayid asks Jack not to come with them as Jack might be unpredictable around Locke. While Sayid is gone, Daniel asks Regina (Zoë Bell), a colleague on the freighter to shoot a projectile onto the island. Regina does so, but the projectile does not arrive for thirty minutes. When it lands, Daniel extracts a clock from the payload and finds that the two times, that running on the island and that running outside, are not synchronized. The survivors led by Locke arrive at the location of Jacob's cabin, but find the area deserted. Locke changes his course to the barracks, and uses Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) to ambush Sayid, Kate and Miles. Kate is watched by James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), and they discuss their reasons for wanting or not wanting to go home. Kate, realizing that she would be arrested for her crimes upon rescue, defects to Locke's group. Sayid negotiates with Locke to exchange Charlotte with Miles, in order to get access to the boat. Locke tells him that wouldn't be necessary as Ben has a spy on that freighter, to which Sayid responds that he would rather sell his soul than trust Ben. At the helicopter, Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) confronts pilot Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) about the picture Naomi had of him and his ex-fiancée Penelope Widmore (Sonya Walger). Frank denies any knowledge of her, but Desmond nevertheless demands a place on a helicopter. At the same time, Sayid returns, with only Charlotte. While Frank accuses Sayid of being dishonest, he considered Miles a ""pain in the ass"", and agrees to fly him offshore. The episode's flashforwards are centered on Sayid in Berlin, who had since become one of the Oceanic Six. He is hired as an assassin, and courts a German woman, Elsa (Thekla Reuten), in order to get closer to her employer (the eponymous ""economist""). After several dates, Sayid turns on Elsa, who reveals herself to be a counter-spy by unexpectedly shooting Sayid in the shoulder. Sayid is able to shoot and kill Elsa. As the episode ends, Sayid is treated for his wound by Ben, who gives him another assignment. Sayid is now wary since they now know that he's after them, to which Ben replies, ""Good"". The story of Sayid's future was influenced by spy fiction—in particular, the writing eventually ""gravitated"" towards a story much like the Jason Bourne franchise. The story was justified by Sayid's status as part of the ""Oceanic Six"", as his celebrity status would provide the perfect cover for his clandestine activities.[4] The episode was written in autumn 2007.[5] At the end of the first scene in Berlin, the flag shown on the building across the street from where Sayid stands is actually that of the former East German GDR. An important scene in the episode regarded Faraday's experiment and the resulting time differential. The scene set up a prominent theme of ""time-travel"" for later episodes.[5] In the episode's respective podcast, Lost's show runners Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof further discussed the time differential as part of an already existing theme regarding transport between the island and the rest of the world. In particular, the theme was alluded to the ""Orchid video"", a Dharma Initiative video that premiered at the 2007 Comic-Con.[6] However, some scenes in the episode gained unintentional significance. The Boston Red Sox won the World Series for the second time in three years after the episode was written, which prompted the question ""Is it possible Lapidus is actually from 2008?"" due to his annoyed reply. Likewise, the only reason that Elsa and Naomi had similar bracelets was that it would serve as an ""emotional touchstone"" for Sayid. After the episode, the producers received several emails about both issues.[5] Andrews enjoyed his role in ""The Economist"". He appreciated that, unlike the third season, he was able to ""push the story forward"", which he thought was ""infinitely more interesting and rewarding."" The premise ""threw [him] for a loop"", and he was pleased with how complex the episode was.[7][8] ""The Economist"" was seen by 13.76 million American viewers, making Lost the fourth most watched program of the week.[9] The episode received a Nielsen rating of 5.8/15 in the key adults 18–49 demographic.[10] In Great Britain, Lost brought in 1.2 million viewers.[11] The first four episodes of the fourth season were watched beforehand by TV Guide, who called them ""worth the wait"" and ""emotionally satisfying"".[12]TV Guide also stated that they ""provide gaspworthy plot twists that should whip fans into a theory-spinning tizzy.""[12] Sarah Vasques of eFluxMedia thought the scene where Daniel discovers the time discrepancy the most mind-blowing scene of the episode.[13]Entertainment Weekly commented that ""for the second straight year, Cupid was kicked in the nuts"", as the episode ""Flashes Before Your Eyes"" also aired on St. Valentine's Day. Also discussed in the review was possible Biblical allegory to the Book of Daniel.[14] However, Mark Madley of The National Post thought that this episode, along with the previous two, gave away too much plot detail, and compared the off-island storyline to ""that awful Stallone/Banderas movie Assassins"".[15] Don Williams of BuddyTV thought that the scene where Sayid disposes of his cellphone after calling Ben ""like an episode of Alias"", and finished his recap by saying ""consider my mind blown again"".[16]MaryAnn Johanson of Film.com called the episode ""mind-blowing"", and theorized that Sayid had been working for Ben before the crash, and that the crash of Oceanic 815 was deliberate.[17] Chris Carabott of IGN stated that, in the episode ""Sayid Jarrah is a badass who could give Jack Bauer, James Bond, and Jason Bourne all a run for their money"", and praised Lost's nature for being able to have ""a lighthearted episode featuring Hurley [one week] and the next can be an action spy thriller starring Sayid."" He praised the episode for being a perfect example of serialized television, and thought that Elsa's double cross to be ""very reminiscent of Vesper Lynd and her true employer in Casino Royale"".

Eggtown,4,4,Stephen Williams,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Greggory Nations,Kate,2008-02-21,13.53,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggtown,"""Eggtown"" is the fourth episode of the fourth season and 76th episode overall of the ABC's serial drama television series Lost. It was aired on February 21, 2008, on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada.[2] It was written by supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and script coordinator Greggory Nations and directed by co-executive producer Stephen Williams.[3] This is the first episode written by Nations. The episode's island plot takes place in late December 2004, 90-plus days after the crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. Flashforwards show Kate Austen (played by Evangeline Lilly) on trial for her numerous pre-island crimes, after her escape from the island.[4] ""Eggtown"" was watched by 15 million people and received mixed reviews from critics. The cliffhanger was generally praised, but the slow pace was criticized. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is keeping Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) prisoner in the basement of the house that he has claimed in the Barracks. He prepares breakfast for him, including the two remaining eggs which he fries along with some fresh melon, but Ben taunts him and Locke becomes frustrated. Kate cuts a deal with Locke's prisoner Miles Straume (Ken Leung): he will tell her what he knows about her if he can speak to Ben for a minute. Miles wants to extort $3.2 million from Ben and in return, Miles promises to lie to his employer claiming Ben is dead. Miles gives Ben a week to produce the cash. Before Locke finds them, Miles reveals that he knows all about Kate's past. Locke banishes Kate from the Barracks and goes to a lake house where Miles is being held captive. Locke puts a grenade in Miles's mouth so that if he ceases to bite, he will die. Kate sleeps with James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) but does not have sex with him. Before Kate leaves for the camp at the beach, she slaps Sawyer across the face after he suggests that she is just pretending to be mad as an excuse to go back to Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and continue their love triangle. Meanwhile, Jack returns to the survivors' beach camp with Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) and newcomers Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) and Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader). Jack and Juliet grow increasingly uneasy over a series of unsuccessful attempts to contact the freighter by satellite phone and verify that Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), who departed for the freighter by helicopter the previous evening,[5] have arrived safely. That evening, as Charlotte tests Daniel's memory using playing cards (Daniel successfully remembers two out of three cards, and Charlotte remarks that this is ""progress""), Jack and Juliet ask if there is another phone number they could try. Charlotte dials an emergency number and speaks to Regina (Zoë Bell), who reports that the helicopter never arrived. After leaving the island, Kate is famous as one of the Oceanic Six. She is tried for her numerous crimes committed before the crash and pleads not guilty. Because Kate is opposed to bringing her son into the trial, Jack is called in as a character witness. He lies in his testimony, saying that Flight 815 crashed in the water, eight survived the crash, but two have since died and Kate was primarily responsible for the Oceanic Six's survival. Kate speaks with her mother Diane Janssen (Beth Broderick) for the first time in four years. Diane is no longer angry at Kate because her perspective changed when she thought that Kate had died in the plane crash. When Diane, the prosecution's star witness, no longer wants to testify against her daughter, the District Attorney makes a plea deal: Kate gets ten years probation, but must stay in the state of California. Jack meets Kate in the parking garage. He admits that he still loves her (in contrast to his false testimony under oath on her behalf) and asks to go out for coffee with her. Kate responds that they cannot go out until he is willing to visit her baby. It is then revealed that Kate is raising Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) son Aaron (William Blanchette) as her own.[6] Greggory ""Gregg"" Nations worked as the script coordinator for the late 1990s CBS television series Nash Bridges.[7]Lost's show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse—the former was a writer and the latter was the show runner for Nash Bridges—hired Nations to serve as Lost's script coordinator in the 2005 alongside pre-production of the second season.[8] Nations rewatched every episode and created a series ""Bible"" and timeline.[9] Nations made his direct Lost writing debut with ""Eggtown"". Nations would be promoted to a coproducer for the show's fifth season.[10] Lindelof and Cuse hyped in September 2007 that ""Eggtown"" would conclude Kate's potential pregnancy.[11] After having sex a few times in the third season,[12] Kate and Sawyer begin to wonder if Kate is pregnant.[13] In ""Eggtown"", Kate exclaims to Sawyer that she is not pregnant and Sawyer rejoices, causing Kate to become angry with him and suddenly leave the Barracks. Evangeline Lilly was excited by Kate's new connection to Aaron. Lilly has said that if she could choose to play another Lost character, it would be Claire because of Aaron. Now she gets to have Aaron while portraying Kate. She also enjoyed Kate having more responsibility because it puts her in a different situation from previous seasons.[6] The word ""Eggtown"" is not directly referenced in the episode, resulting in online speculation and confusion.[14] According to Lindelof and Cuse, it has been ""the most questioned title of the show"".[15] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the title was a reference to the ancient cosmic egg concept or the chicken or the egg causality dilemma,[16] while John Kubicek of BuddyTV guessed that it was a shout-out to the children's book and film called The Easter Egg Adventure, which depicts roosters attempting to steal Easter eggs from the animals of a place called Egg Town or that it was an allusion to the Great Depression slang term, which was used in the 1930s when describing a bad deal.[17] Lindelof and Cuse confirmed that the episode was primarily named as such because Locke fries eggs for Ben's breakfast and secondarily because the story deals with Kate's possible pregnancy.[18] ""Eggtown"" continues Lost's pattern of featuring numerous literary references,[19] which may allude to a favourite book of the writers or a story similar to that of a character.[20] Locke gives Ben Philip K. Dick's VALIS, a 1981 science fiction novel about a gnostic vision of one aspect of God.[21] Sawyer reads The Invention of Morel, a 1940 science fiction novel by Argentine writer Adolfo Bioy Casares about a fugitive who hides on a deserted Pacific island where the people are only images and do not exist.[22] Hurley also asks James if he would like to watch Xanadu or a fictional film called Satan's Doom but James replies saying that he is reading a book. Hurley then plays Xanadu and we hear the film's title song. ""Eggtown"" was watched by 13.647 million American viewers, ranking Lost seventh of the week in Nielsen ratings.[23] The episode was watched by a total of 15.438 million viewers, including those who watched within seven days of broadcast, making it the most recorded show of the week; this number went toward the year-end season average.[24] It received at least 5.7/13 in the key adults 18–49 demographic.[25] The Canadian broadcast was seen by 1.615 million people, making it the ninth most watched show of the week.[26] In the United Kingdom, Lost brought in 1.1 million viewers.[27] Amidst speculation that Lost would be pulled from the schedule, 780,000 Australians tuned in to ""Eggtown"" and made it the nineteenth most watched show of the night.[28] Nevertheless, it was in the top ten programs of the night in each of the key adults 25–54, 18–49 and 16–39 demographics.[29] Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Lilly's performance, saying that it was almost worthy of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.[30]TV Guide's Michael Ausiello dubbed ""Eggtown"" the best episode of the first four episodes of the fourth season.[31] Nikki Stafford of Wizard described it as a ""great episode"" and observed that it features ""the first conversation between Jin and Sun [of the] season. Interesting that last season so many fans were up in arms for the [early third season] because we didn't get to see enough of the other characters, and this season we're seeing even less of the others, yet no one is complaining. Looks like the writers finally found the right balance.""[14]Entertainment Weekly's Jeff Jensen thought that the episode ""was all about moving all the simmering subplots forward so the next episodes can drive them home"".[16]Kristin Dos Santos of E! called the episode's final plot twist ""fantastic"" and ""unexpected"".[32]Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones called it the best of the first four episodes of the season with four out of five stars, saying that ""the courtroom scenes were very well executed, with a marked difference in the characterisation of Jack [who] has become known as the trustworthy, honest type since Oceanic Flight 815 crashed, so his blatant lies about the island under oath were definitely dramatic.""[33] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad reviewed ""Eggtown"" positively, writing that it ""not many shows could mix topics like blackmail, grenades, and motherhood into one episode, but Lost pulled it off.""[34] Jon Lachonis of UGO claimed that Lost ""again blew everybody's minds"" with ""Eggtown"".[35]BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl commented that ""those last few [flash]forward scenes were genius. The writers really out-did themselves.""[36] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post thought that ""Eggtown"" ""effectively kept up the frantic pace that this season has set, answering some really good questions while effectively bringing up new ones.""[37] Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times found ""Eggtown"" to be set at a slower pace than other episodes of the season and said that ""the witness stand as forum for revelation … holds no appeal for me.""[38]Newsday's Diane Werts had mixed feelings about ""Eggtown"". She criticized the lack of plot twists, stating that ""that last-second 'reveal' of [Kate raising Aaron] turned out to be a bit of a dud"". Werts also critiqued the execution and acting, calling the trial ""blandly delivered"" and Lilly and Fox ""expressionless"".[39] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger dubbed ""Eggtown"" ""the weakest episode of the season"",[40] partially because he also was unimpressed with the lack of plot twists and does not find Kate to be a compelling character.[41]The San Diego Union-Tribune's Karla Peterson gave a mixed review, writing that ""last night's Lost was not amazing, until it slammed us upside the head with a plot curveball that left us unable to remember whatever doubts we may have had, say, one minute before.""[42] Daniel of TMZ gave the episode a ""D"", partially because the twist ending had been spoiled for him.[43]IGN's Chris Carabott rated it the worst of the first four by scoring it as a 7.6/10. He wrote that the flashforward was ""out of place"" and that the ""final revelation was shocking … but Lost can't survive on shock value alone.""[44] Daniel MacEachern of Television Without Pity gave the episode a ""B"", the lowest grade for a fourth season episode from the website.[45]",4456,8.1
The Constant,4,5,Jack Bender,Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof,Desmond,2008-02-28,12.850000000000001,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constant,"""The Constant"" is the fifth episode of the fourth season of the American Broadcasting Company's (ABC) serial drama television series Lost, and the 77th episode overall. It was broadcast on February 28, 2008, on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada.[2] It was written by executive producer Carlton Cuse and co-creator/executive producer Damon Lindelof and directed by executive producer Jack Bender.[3] ""The Constant"" was watched by 15 million American viewers and is widely regarded as one of Lost's best episodes.[4][5][6] It was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards, a Directors Guild of America Award, and a Hugo Award. In the episode, Desmond Hume (played by Henry Ian Cusick) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) are being flown by Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) to the freighter where Lapidus' mission is set. After going through turbulence, Desmond's consciousness unexpectedly travels through time between 1996 and 2004. The helicopter reaches the freighter and Sayid and Desmond are introduced to communications officer George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens), who is ""unstuck in time"" like Desmond.[7] The writers took twice the time expected to develop the episode's script;[8] the biggest concern was the avoidance of a temporal paradox when dealing with time travel.[9] Desmond, Sayid and Lapidus experience turbulence while flying the 80 miles (about 130 kilometers) distance from the island where they were stranded to Lapidus' team's freighter, the Kahana. Desmond's consciousness travels back eight years to 1996, when he is serving with the British Army's Royal Scots Regiment. Moments later, when his consciousness returns to the present day, he neither knows where he is nor recognizes his companions, and has no memory of his life since 1996. After the helicopter lands, Desmond continues to jump between 1996 and 2004. He is taken to the sick bay, where a man named Minkowski is strapped to a bed because he is experiencing similar problems. Minkowski explains that someone sabotaged the radio room two days earlier and that Desmond's ex-girlfriend Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger) has been trying to contact the freighter. Sayid uses the satellite phone to contact Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) on the island and explains that Desmond appears to have amnesia. Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), a physicist from the freighter, asks Jack whether Desmond has recently been exposed to a high level of radiation or electromagnetism. Jack is unsure, and so Daniel speaks to Desmond and asks him about his situation. Desmond responds that he believes that he is in 1996 and is serving with the Royal Scots. Faraday understands and tells Desmond that when he returns to 1996, he needs to go to the physics department of The Queen's College, Oxford University in England to meet with Daniel's past self, and gives Desmond some mechanical settings to relay, along with an extra phrase that Daniel assures him will convince Daniel's past self that the story is legitimate. Desmond's flashbacks become more frequent and longer. In 1996, Desmond tracks down a younger Faraday at Oxford, who takes Desmond into his laboratory where he is experimenting with a time machine. Setting his electromagnetic device with the settings that Desmond has given him, Daniel places his laboratory rat, Eloise, in a maze and exposes her to electromagnetic energy. The rat appears to become comatose, then awakens and runs the maze. Daniel becomes excited because he had just built the maze and had not yet taught Eloise how to run it. Desmond realizes that, like the rat, he is caught in a time warp that is moving his consciousness between two different bodies at two different points in time and space. Eloise dies of a suspected brain aneurysm brought on by the exposure to the time lapse. Desmond becomes worried that he will die like Eloise, and Daniel instructs him to find something or someone—a constant—who is present in both times and can serve as an anchor for Desmond's mental stability. Desmond decides that Penny can be the constant; however, he must make contact with her in 2004. To find out where she lives, Desmond gets her address from her father Charles (Alan Dale), who is at an auction buying a journal owned by Tovard Hanso written by a crew member of the 19th century ship called the Black Rock. In 1996, Desmond finds Penny, who is still distraught over their break-up and is not willing to see him. However, he gets her telephone number and tells her not to change it because he will call her on Christmas Eve 2004. In 2004, Sayid, Desmond, and Minkowski escape the sick bay and begin to repair the broken communications equipment. Meanwhile, Minkowski enters into another flashback, and dies. Showing signs of suffering the same fate as Minkowski, Desmond telephones Penny, who tells Desmond that she has been searching for him for the past three years and they reconcile before the power is cut off. Having made contact with his ""constant"", Desmond stops alternating between 1996 and 2004. Back on the island, Daniel flips through his journal and discovers a note that he had written, ""If anything goes wrong, Desmond Hume will be my constant."" ""The Constant"" is the second Lost episode to deal directly with the concept of time travel after ""Flashes Before Your Eyes"" from the third season. While promoting that episode, Lindelof said that it uses the flashback device ""in a way we never have before and never will again""[10] and while promoting ""The Constant"", he said that it ""upholds that pledge, unpledges it, then repledges it.""[11]Lost's writer-producers enjoy science fiction themes such as time travel; however, they were careful not to create a paradox. The rules for time-travel in the series are outlined in ""Flashes Before Your Eyes""—although, Lindelof has said that ""The Constant"" is a more important episode in terms of explaining time travel on the show[8]—by Ms. Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), who explains that certain events are inevitable and the universe will eventually correct any errors.[12] Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened.[13] The writers hoped that ""The Constant"" would further establish that there are no parallel universes or alternate realities. Lindelof reminisced that ""just breaking that episode was such a massive headache"" and Cuse added that ""it was definitely like doing the hardest New York Times crossword puzzle for the week"".[14] Cuse and Lindelof admitted they took some inspiration from the final episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, ""All Good Things..."", where Captain Picard jumps between three time frames. The Lost writers compared Minkowski's role to Q, as ""someone who is undergoing and understands the same events as our protagonist"". Faraday, on the other hand, was the expert that always appears in time travel fiction—as Lindelof put it, ""He's our Doc Brown here, who basically is gonna tell the protagonist to go and find him in the past"".[15] Whereas the average Lost episode took two weeks to plan and write, ""The Constant"" took five because the writers experienced difficulty when determining its effect on future stories.[8]Popular Mechanics analyzed the possibility of time travel using Lost's rules. Michio Kaku claimed that ""the show's producers did their homework"". According to Kaku, ""there's no law of physics preventing this kind of time travel—just a lack of know-how … [but] it would take a very advanced civilization to really do this"".[9] Cuse stated that ""we [the writers] try to use enough science to give a sense of credibility"".[8] ""The Constant"" was the first episode set on the Kahana, but the writers decided to avoid using the new setting just to give new information—Lindelof has declared that ""you would have mindless exposition unless the characters were in a constant state of crisis"". According to Lindelof, Desmond's confusion prevents the characters who arrived from the island from asking questions to the freighter's crew.[15] Shooting occurred in the second half of October 2007.[16] The scenes on the freighter in this and later episodes were filmed for several days on a freighter ten to fifteen minutes off the west coast of Oahu, Hawaii, where Lost is filmed. Instead of docking the ship and returning to the ocean each day, the actors and crew slept on the freighter in areas that were not being used for filming.[17] The Oxford scenes were shot at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Honolulu.[18] In 1996, Desmond has short hair and no facial hair and in 2004, Desmond sports long and untamed hair with a full beard. Cusick did not cut his hair; it was hidden underneath a short-haired wig by ""really talented hair and makeup folks"", according to Carlton Cuse. All freighter scenes were shot before Cusick shaved most of his beard for the 1996 scenes. A fake beard was glued onto Cusick for the episodes ""Ji Yeon"" and ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" while his beard grew back.[19] The equations on Faraday's chalkboard were written by a physicist who was hired as a consultant by the producers.[18] The way the transitions between the 1996 and 2004 scenes would take place was frequently discussed during production. The producers took the advice of editor Mark Goldman, who suggested sudden cuts with ""no fancy effect, and in some cases, no sound cut"", similar to the way ""All Good Things..."" was edited. The original ending would set up the following episode by having Charlotte (Rebecca Mader) drop a bag containing a gas mask at Faraday's feet. But the producers thought it did not work after the emotional scenes between Desmond and Penny, and decided to finish with Faraday reading his diary.[15] Jeremy Davies, who plays Daniel Faraday, said ""I thought it was a remarkably well-written and brilliantly conceived story. I was quite knocked out by it on a lot of levels."" He called it ""remarkable storytelling.""[20] In its original American broadcast, ""The Constant"" was watched by 12.893 million viewers, ranking Lost eighth in weekly ratings.[21] The episode was watched by a total of 14.998 million viewers, including those who watched within seven days of broadcast, making it the most recorded show of the week; this number went toward the year-end season average.[22] It received 5.4/13 in the key adults 18–49 demographic.[23] The Canadian broadcast was watched by 1.529 million people, making it the sixth most watched show of the week.[24] In the United Kingdom, ""The Constant"" was watched by 911,000 viewers.[25] 770,000 Australians tuned into Lost,[26] placing it seventy-fifth in the weekly ratings chart.[27] ""The Constant"" received universal acclaim from both critics and fans and is often cited as the best episode of the entire series. Time named ""The Constant"" the best television episode of 2008,[6] and according to Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV, ""lots of people"" referred to it as ""the best Lost episode ever"".[5] It was listed as the best episode of Lost by IGN,[4]Los Angeles Times,[28] and ABC2,[29] and was also featured in similar lists by TV Guide,[30] and National Post.[31] In Entertainment Weekly, Alejandro Garay wrote, ""One of my favorite episodes of 2008 was Lost’s 'The Constant.' It was a beautiful episode that made us fans fall in love with the show even more. The creators managed to build momentum with smart narrative, by using the romance card to develop such a complicated topic as time traveling. It was exquisite, mind-blowing, impeccably done, and unforgettable.""[32] Bill Keveney of USA Today wrote that it is ""arguably the most highly praised episode of [the] well-received fourth season"",[8] while his colleague Robert Bianco deemed Henry Ian Cusick worthy of an Emmy Award nomination.[33] Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times called the episode a ""mind-blowing tour de force"".[34] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune called it a ""for-the-ages episode"" with ""a classic Lost moment"" in Desmond and Penny's phone call and ""an especially spine-tingling performance"" by Cusick.[35] Verne Gay of Newsday wrote, ""last night's forty-four minutes of Lost were among the most satisfying forty-four minutes in front of the tube in my life."" He added that ""it wasn't merely a brilliant episode, which pushed the mythology forward more rapidly and richly than any episode in my memory, but it was an emotional release … I actually cried when Penny and Desmond finally … connected"" and ""there wasn't one, single, solitary false note"".[36] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that ""it was brilliantly executed, as both a brain-twister and as a love story"" with an ""outstanding"" performance by Jeremy Davies.[37] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as ""the best single outing since season 1's 'Walkabout'""[38] and named the phone call between Desmond and Penny the best moment of the season excluding any moments from the then yet-to-air season finale.[39] Nikki Stafford of Wizard described ""The Constant"" as ""mindblowing"" and cited it as ""the reason the hardcore fans love Lost.""[40] Matt Roush of TV Guide said that ""the time-tripping went into overdrive with this week's brilliant episode … [which] worked beautifully as a showcase for Henry Ian Cusick as the tormented Desmond. It was almost a stand-alone episode, a Twilight Zone/X-Files-style adventure with a start, middle and killer finish.""[41] Kristin Dos Santos of E! ""loved every minute"" and admitted that ""this was one of [her] all-time favorite episodes, what with the undying love business and this indisputable fact: Henry Ian Cusick can frakking act"".[42] ""The Constant"" received high praise from IGN reviewer Chris Carabott calling it ""a brilliantly executed hour of television "" and ""one of the finest episodes in the series"". He gave it 10/10, tying it with ""Pilot – Part One"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"" as the best reviewed episode of Lost.[43] LTG of Television Without Pity gave the episode an ""A+""—the highest grade for any Lost episode.[44] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad loved the episode and its unique flashback structure. ""The Constant"" strengthened her love for Desmond and Penny's story, saying ""my heart won't break if none of [Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Juliet] end up together [but] if Desmond and Penny don't reunite, I will be devastated.""[45] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV gave ""The Constant"" an excellent review, saying that ""my mind has never spun this fast after a Lost episode"" and the writers have ""really outdone themselves"" and ""do not get enough credit for constantly tinkering with their story structure"".[5] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post said that this ""episode of Lost not only continued this season's thrilling momentum; it proved to fans that even in its fourth season, it still leaves us with our jaws hanging open … this was the make of possibly one of my favorite Lost episodes ever."" Glatfelter also praised the characters, Daniel ""more and more becoming one of [his] favorite characters"" and calling Desmond ""the most intriguing character on Lost [with] the best love story on the show and dare I say on television today"".[46] Daniel of TMZ graded the episode as an ""A+"", considering it to be one of the best Lost episodes. In his review, he compared television to film—specifically ""The Constant"" to No Country for Old Men, the 2007 Academy Award winner for Best Picture—and decided that television is far superior.[47] Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune wrote that ""[I was] almost as touched and relieved by the reunion as Desmond and Penny are""; however, she did not review ""The Constant"" as favorably as other critics, giving it an ""A–"".[48] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal gave ""The Constant"" a mixed review. He described it as ""an entertaining episode [with] a fine acting performance by Henry Ian Cusick"", but criticized Desmond's repetitive story arc, criticized Frank's character, said that ""Jeff Fahey is a fine actor, but so far, his character just hasn't really evolved enough for me to care yet"" and concluded, ""this episode didn't seem to really raise or answer anything of major importance, so I can't help but feel that it was nothing more than mid-season filler.""[49] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy graded it with four out of five stars, and wrote that ""a refreshing shift in Lost's tone enabled loyal viewers to have their hearts warmed by the long distance smoochfest between Desmond and his beloved Penny"".[50] In 2018, the popular culture and sports website The Ringer created a list of the 100 best episodes of television in the 21st century. ""The Constant"" was the number one episode on the list.[51] ""The Constant"" was nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for a One-Hour Series and Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Original Dramatic Score) at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards. Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, (July 17, 2008)[52] It was Lost's representative episode for Outstanding Drama Series and was indeed nominated, losing to Mad Men. Henry Ian Cusick and Jeremy Davies each submitted this episode for consideration on their own behalf for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.[53] This episode was also considered for Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. The episode was nominated for the 2009 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. Jack Bender was nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Drama Series.",11845,9.7
The Other Woman,4,6,Eric Laneuville,Drew Goddard & Christina M. Kim,Juliet,2008-03-06,12.9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Woman_(Lost),"""The Other Woman"" is the 78th episode of the serial drama television series Lost and the sixth episode of the show's fourth season. It aired on March 6, 2008 on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States and on CTV in Canada.[2] The episode was written by co-executive producer Drew Goddard and executive story editor Christina M. Kim, and was directed by Eric Laneuville.[3] The narrative begins on December 24, 2004, 94 days after the crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. Recent island arrivals Daniel Faraday (played by Jeremy Davies) and Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) leave the survivors' camp without notice for the Dharma Initiative electrical station called the Tempest. In flashbacks that depict events on the island, Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) discovers that her boss Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), the leader of the island's original inhabitants referred to as the Others, is in love with her.[4] The writers advanced several story lines with ""The Other Woman"". The episode furthers Juliet's back story and relationships, sheds more light on the season's new characters, and features the first appearance of Harper Stanhope (Andrea Roth). The introduction of the Tempest further develops the series' mythology, specifically the ""purge"". In the third season, the purge was mentioned in episode ""Enter 77"" and seen in ""The Man Behind the Curtain"".[5] ""The Other Woman"" was watched by 15 million Americans and received mixed reviews. Critics from the Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Weekly, and BuddyTV deemed it the worst episode of the season, partially due to a flashback storyline that was seemingly recycled from the third season episode, ""One of Us"". Another criticism was that audiences actually learned more about Ben than Juliet, despite the focus on Juliet. Emerson also received more praise for his acting than Mitchell, who plays Juliet; however, Mitchell won a Saturn Award for her performance. Positive reviews commended the action in the episode's climax. The episode opens with flashbacks to Juliet's life on the island following her recruitment in September 2001 by the Others.[6] Juliet has an affair with an Other named Goodwin (Brett Cullen), who is married to therapist Harper Stanhope. Harper discovers the affair, and warns Juliet that their leader Ben will punish Goodwin because he has a crush on Juliet. Following the crash of Flight 815, Ben sends him to infiltrate a group of surviving passengers; Goodwin is killed by Ana Lucia Cortez after she realizes he is not a survivor.[7] In October 2004, Ben invites Juliet to what he initially describes as a dinner party, but is actually a private date. Ben leads Juliet to Goodwin's impaled corpse, where she accuses him of having wanted Goodwin to die. Ben then subsequently reveals his love for her. On the night of December 24, 2004 (three months after the crash of Flight 815), two members of a science team from the Kahana freighter anchored offshore[8]—Daniel and Charlotte—who landed on the island three days earlier with a hidden agenda, sneak off to find the Tempest. Juliet and the crash survivors' leader Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) notice their absence from the beach camp and pursue them. After hearing the whispers, Harper approaches Juliet. She tells her that Daniel and Charlotte intend to kill everyone on the island by deploying a lethal gas at the Tempest and that Ben's orders are for Juliet to kill them. On a trek back to the beach in the morning, Kate encounters Daniel and Charlotte and is knocked unconscious by the latter. Jack and Juliet come across Kate and they split up: Juliet continues for the Tempest alone, as Jack minds Kate. Inside the station, Juliet finds Daniel in a hazmat suit at a computer. After a standoff, Daniel and Charlotte convince Juliet that they are not going to kill anyone; they are neutralizing the gas in case Ben decides to use it again, as he had twelve years earlier in an Others-led purge of Dharma.[9] Jack arrives at the Tempest and Juliet explains that those on the freighter came to the island to wage war against Ben and she expects him to win. She fears for Jack because Ben thinks that she belongs to him, but Jack shows no worry and kisses her. In the Barracks, Ben bargains with 815 survivor John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) for his freedom. He reveals that Charles Widmore (Alan Dale)—the father of Desmond Hume's (Henry Ian Cusick) girlfriend, Penny (Sonya Walger)[10]—owns the freighter and hopes to exploit the island. Ben also tells Locke who his spy on the freighter is. Ben continues to reside in the Barracks following his release. When asked about what she learned about her character through ""The Other Woman"", Elizabeth Mitchell surmised that Juliet's ""mistakes are morally questionable, if not morally wrong. But you do see that behind this is a human being who is struggling to live and have a life that makes sense to her.""[12] Mitchell did not think that Juliet was too surprised that Ben has romantic feelings for her, but ""it was horrifying under the circumstances"" because she had just found out that Goodwin had died. Michael Emerson thought that his character Ben was childish when he shouted ""you're mine!"" to Juliet; Mitchell compared him to ""a twelve-year-old boy throwing a temper tantrum over ... his first love"".[13] Mitchell said that ""it was emotionally draining shooting this episode"" because she was intimidated by Emerson and Matthew Fox's acting skills.[11] Co-executive producer and staff writer Adam Horowitz stated that ""It's always interesting to pull back another layer on one of our characters, and to see another chapter in Juliet's story on the island and bring us to where she is now was great"", while fellow co-executive producer and staff writer Edward Kitsis thought that ""the interesting thing about the episode is the way Ben looks at Juliet ... everything is informed by that look."" Horowitz also enjoyed the juxtaposition of Juliet's character development with the revelations on the ""freighter folk"". Kitsis picked the episode's final scene where Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) discover that Ben has negotiated his release and will be dining with them that evening as his favorite of the episode.[14] Actress Rebecca Mader, who plays Charlotte, said that she was ""so excited"" for the episode to air because she thought that it was ""even better"" than the previous episode,[15] which is widely regarded as one of the best episodes of the series.[16] Charlotte knocks Kate unconscious with the barrel of her gun and asks ""what?"" to a speechless Daniel in ""The Other Woman"". Mader found this hilarious and described it as ""the pinnacle of [her] career"".[17] Andrea Roth makes her first appearance as Harper in ""The Other Woman"". During casting in early October, Harper was described as ""a tough, no-nonsense and beautiful [therapist who has a tendency to be] overly controlling and obsessive."" The character was also noted as a recurring role;[18] however, Harper did not make another appearance in the season. The writers have since stated that she will eventually reappear.[19] A jungle scene with Mitchell, Fox and Roth was filmed until 4:00 a.m. on October 27, 2007[20] with industrial sprinklers[21] and Mitchell referred to this as her ""most intense experience on the show"".[22] Harper's appearance and disappearance in this scene are sudden so fans speculated that this was actually an apparition or manifestation of the island's black smoke monster. This was refuted by Lost's writers.[23] Named after William Shakespeare's 1610 play of the same name, the Tempest first appears in ""The Other Woman"" and is apparently alluded to on an unseen layer of the Dharma ""Swan"" station's blast door map of the second season.[19] The writers wanted to explain some of the island's history in the fourth season and decided that ""The Other Woman"" would reveal where the gas that Ben used came from and that Dharma had stations set up for protection against hostile forces. They also enjoyed having Goodwin on the show and wanted to bring him back.[19] ""The Other Woman"" had commenced filming by October 11, 2007[24] and was completed on October 30.[25] ""The Other Woman"" contains Jack and Juliet's second kiss.[26] Juliet was conceived by the writers as the next possible love interest for Jack[27] after the death of the second season character Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez).[28] Fans hated Ana Lucia so the writers did not pursue the romantic story arc.[29] Mitchell guesses that her character was created because ""they needed a bridge between Ben and everyone else, and they needed someone to come in and be a little salt in the oyster of Jack and Kate.""[11] She believes that Juliet did genuinely fall in love with Jack,[30] but not knowing whether ""her attraction to Jack or her willingness to do anything to get off the island"" is more important to her.[11] Juliet forms something of a ""love rectangle"" with Jack, Kate and Sawyer.[31] Mitchell ""feel[s] like [Jack and Juliet have] a very grown-up relationship. They seem to really respect and like each other"", whereas Sawyer and Kate are like ""rambunctious teenagers"".[11] The couple has gained an Internet fandom and been given the portmanteau nickname ""Jacket"".[32] ""The Other Woman"" was watched live or recorded and watched within five hours of broadcast by 13.008 million viewers in the United States,[33] ranking seventh for the week in television programs with the most viewers and achieving a 5.4/13 in the coveted adults aged eighteen to forty-nine demographic.[34] Including those who watched within seven days of broadcast, the episode was watched by a total of 14.933 million American viewers; this number went toward the season's average.[35] 1.439 million Canadians watched it, making Lost the eighth highest-rated show of the week.[36] In the United Kingdom, 1.1 million people viewed the episode.[37] The episode brought in 691,000 viewers in Australia, placing it as the twenty-second most watched show of the night.[38] A common claim by critics of Entertainment Weekly, IGN,[39]SyFy Portal, AOL's TV Squad[40] and BuddyTV was that more was learned about supporting player Ben, instead of Juliet who was centered on in flashbacks. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly praised Emerson's acting and stated that ""in the end, this was really a story about Ben and the lengths he will go to protect himself and the Island from his enemies.""[41] SyFy Portal's Dan Compora said that ""The more I hate Ben, the more I realize that Michael Emerson is just a very fine actor doing his job.""[42] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called Emerson an acting ""god"" and said that ""The Other Woman"" was ""ostensibly a Juliet episode, [but] Ben's presence made a far bigger impression on me"".[43] Despite Emerson's shadow, Elizabeth Mitchell received the award for ""Best Supporting Actress on Television"" at the 34th Saturn Awards in a tie with Summer Glau, who plays Cameron Phillips in FOX's Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.[44] ""The Other Woman"" has been cited as the weakest episode of Lost's fourth season. Despite his claim, Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times pointed out that ""even this so-so episode of Lost stood far above anything else being shown on network TV this season"". He noted that the ""most heartbreaking scene"" was Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) appearance because it reminded him of how little the character had done to advance the season's plot.[45] BuddyTV's John Kubicek dubbed ""The Other Woman"" ""the worst episode of Lost season four so far"" because it ""followed the soap opera that is the romantic entanglements of the major players, which is not the reason most people love Lost.""[46] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly graded the episode as a ""C–"" and called it ""the only true dud of the season"".[47] He thought that its ""story was kinda all over the place"" and that ""the whole thing felt forced"". Jensen was not fond of Andrea Roth's guest performance because he felt that ""she came off as too arch and unreal.""[48] In contrast, TV Guide's Bruce Fretts praised Roth's ""suitably creepy"" appearance.[49] Other critics also reviewed the episode as poor. Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune said that ""The Other Woman"" ""seemed somewhat pallid and predictable … several elements … felt like they'd been recycled from previous seasons and story arcs.""[50]The Star-Ledger's Alan Sepinwall considered the episode to be the second weakest of the fourth season after ""Eggtown"". He criticized the Tempest storyline due to a lack of explanation for the station's original purpose and thought that Juliet's flashbacks were redundant.[51] ""The Other Woman"" was also the subject of mixed reviews. Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that ""I really liked this episode, but I liked it less than the [preceding episodes] … it seems that someone took their foot off the gas just a fraction and the reduction in speed was notable.[52]Time's James Poniewozik had mixed feelings for the flashbacks, but enjoyed Ben's character development.[53] Nikki Stafford of Wizard ""enjoyed"" the ""interesting"" episode, although ""not nearly as much"" as the previous episode. She rejoiced at the return of her ""favorite Other"" Tom (M.C. Gainey) and wrote that ""Locke used to be one of [her] favorite characters, but now he's a tool"".[54]Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones stated that ""the episode came together nicely in the end, with an expected twist and a snog, although for a great part it bordered on tedium. Juliet is a character who simply isn't interesting enough to fully sustain one's attention over a flashback. She's been so peripheral and irrelevant over this season, and it felt like a token gesture to foreground her at last. There was a nice pay off though, with a long awaited smooch between her and Jack.""[55] Daniel of TMZ graded the episode as a ""C+""; however, he wrote that ""the Ben/Locke scenes were great and Juliet in a bikini did not disappoint.""[56] TV Squad's Erin Martell was ""not impressed with Jack and Juliet's chemistry"" and found their kiss ""unconvincing"". Martell commended Emerson's acting, Ben's one-liners and his ""too funny for words"" casual greeting to Hurley and Sawyer at the end of the episode after he is released from captivity.[40]The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought that ""this was another great episode [that] could have lived up to last week's episode, but there was still a lot of solid character development.""[57] Verne Gay of Newsday referred to the episode as ""yet another brilliant outing by TV's best drama [that] keeps getting better""; she was not the only critic to give a positive review.[58]E!'s Kristin Dos Santos thought that the fight scene between Juliet and Charlotte in the Tempest was ""awesome"" and suggested that Alan Dale receive a ""lifetime achievement award for his parade of marvelously malicious patriarchs"", such as Widmore.[59] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a score of eight out of ten and described it as ""a good episode of Lost that has all the action, suspense and excitement that this show consistently delivers"". Carabott wrote that ""seeing how twisted [Ben and Juliet's] 'relationship' really is was fascinating"".[39] SyFy Portal's Dan Compora wrote that ""this week's episode contributed to what is shaping up to be a pretty solid fourth season. … Fine acting carried the episode despite a few potholes in the plot.""[42] Compora also enjoyed the title and the ""nice cat fight"" in the Tempest between Juliet and Charlotte.[60]",4342,7.9
Ji Yeon,4,7,Stephen Semel,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Sun & Jin,2008-03-13,11.870000000000001,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji_Yeon,"""Ji Yeon"" (/ˌdʒiː ˈjiːɒn/; from Korean 지연 [tɕi jʌn]) is the seventh episode of the American Broadcasting Company's fourth season of Lost and 79th episode overall. The episode was written by co-executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, and directed by regular Lost editor Stephen Semel. It was first aired in the United States and Canada on March 13, 2008. It is the first episode to feature Harold Perrineau since his departure at the last episode of the second season, and features Zoë Bell as a guest star. ""Ji Yeon"" was watched by 12 million American viewers and received mostly positive reviews. Before the premiere of the fourth season, the principal cast of Lost called ""Ji Yeon"" the most shocking of the first seven episodes.[2] The title of the episode is the name of Sun's daughter, and means ""flower of wisdom.""[3] The episode's story focuses on married couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). In late 2004, on the island, they debate whether to defect to the rival faction of survivors led by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn). Intercut throughout the episode, a series of off-island scenes show Sun about to give birth and Jin experiencing a series of difficulties in his efforts to reach the hospital with a gift of a stuffed panda. The ending shows that Jin's and Sun's scenes do not focus on the same birth; Jin's scenes are flashbacks to events before the plane crash, while Sun's are flashforwards to sometime after she escapes the island. A subplot follows Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) on board the Kahana, where they learn more about the freighter's mission and find somebody they once knew. The episode's off-island storyline seemingly depicts Jin rushing to the hospital while Sun, who has become one of the ""Oceanic Six"", goes into labor. Jin's journey to the hospital is marred by several unfortunate incidents, including difficulty in purchasing a stuffed panda and his cell phone being broken. Sun gives birth to a girl, who she names ""Ji Yeon"", the name chosen by Jin. The final off-island scenes establish that Jin and Sun's stories are separate; Jin's story is set in the past, two months into his marriage to Sun. He was rushing to the birth of a Chinese ambassador's grandson to deliver the panda as a gift on behalf of his employer, Sun's father. In the final flashforward, Sun and her daughter are visited by Hurley (Jorge Garcia), who takes her to pay her respects to Jin. His tombstone indicates that he died on the day of the crash of Oceanic 815. Sun becomes increasingly worried and suspicious about the intentions of the Kahana crew. Despite Juliet Burke's (Elizabeth Mitchell) warning to Sun that women who conceive on the island die during their second trimester, Sun arranges to defect with Jin to the rival faction led by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), who does not want to leave the island. Juliet tries to stop Sun from leaving by telling Jin that Sun had an affair, causing him to angrily back out of the journey at the last minute. After having a heartfelt conversation while fishing with Bernard Nadler, the only other married man on the island, he forgives Sun, who assures him that the baby is his. On the Kahana, Desmond and Sayid are still waiting to speak to the captain of the freighter, Gault (Grant Bowler). When they are taken to see him, Regina (Zoë Bell) jumps off the side of the ship, having wrapped herself in chains, but Gault dismisses it as ""a heightened case of cabin fever"", and asserts that losing her is better than losing several more in saving her. He says that he is employed by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Desmond's girlfriend's father, and later takes them into his cabin, and tells that Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) faked the plane crash by expending tremendous resources in the process and procured 324 dead bodies to make everybody believe that all the passengers were dead. Gault proceeds by saying that is one of the reasons why Mr. Widmore is keen on finding Benjamin Linus and the island. After their meeting, Desmond and Sayid are relocated to a different part of the ship, where they meet Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau, Jr.), who has not appeared since the second season finale, working as a deckhand under the alias ""Kevin Johnson"". The episode was filmed in late October and early November 2007, primarily on the island of Oahu, where Lost is filmed.[4][5] Several days before shooting, Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. His arrest prompted speculation about his future on the series, due to co-stars Michelle Rodriguez (Ana-Lucia Cortez) and Cynthia Watros (Libby) leaving Lost after DUI arrests.[6][7][8] With the revelation of Sun as one of the Oceanic Six, all six members have been revealed. Executive producers and writers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof left the identity of the sixth deliberately ambiguous to provoke debate after the episode.[9] ""Ji Yeon"" is the first episode since the second season finale, ""Live Together, Die Alone"", in which Harold Perrineau, Jr. appears as Michael Dawson. Perrineau was the only actor from the original cast of fourteen to not appear in the third season of Lost. Perrineau was ""really hurt"" by the creative decision to leave him out, and went on to appear in the British horror film 28 Weeks Later and Demons, a pilot for CBS. When the latter was not picked up by CBS, Perrineau returned to Lost; his return was confirmed during Lost's slot at the 2007 Comic-Con International.[10] ""Ji Yeon"" was watched live or recorded and watched within six hours of broadcast by 12.083 million viewers in the United States,[11] achieving a 4.9/13 in the key adults 18–49 demographic[12] and ranking fourth for the week in viewers.[11] The episode brought in 689 000 viewers in Australia and was in the top five key adults 25–54 and 18–49 demographics for the night.[13] Mark Madley of the National Post praised the episode for ""[continuing] the near-perfect season four"". He asked ""has there ever been an episode that answered so many questions yet advanced the plot so little?"", but immediately noted that the question was not negative. He also found Jin's line ""I will hunt you down and rip your head off!"" particularly humorous.[14] Tim Goodman, critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, thought highly of the romantic plot of the episode, and more generally the characters of Jin and Sun, noting that ""Lost has always treated the Jin and Sun relationship with both interest and respect"" and ""few primetime televised portrayals of intimacy among Asians have been this well done.""[15] Matt Roush of TV Guide stated that the episode made him cry, the ""ultimate compliment in the Roush playbook"". Later in his review, he commented he was ""already a puddle of emotion before the climactic reveal"".[16] In comparison, the TMZ.com staff gave a largely negative review. The reviewer thought that ""[they] feel like [Lindelof and Cuse] purposely manipulated us with Jin's flashback and the reveal really wasn't even all that interesting as a result. And the reveal of Michael being the man on the boat was as un-suspenseful as it was predictable"", and thought Sun's request for Jin to be at her bedside was deceptive, and rehashed Jack Shephard's (Matthew Fox) comment about his deceased father in ""Through the Looking Glass"".[17]Television Without Pity's LTG gave the episode an ""A-"", called it ""trippy"" and ""confusing"" and also praised Yunjin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim's performances as ""fantastic"".[18]",4455,8.4
Meet Kevin Johnson,4,8,Stephen Williams,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Brian K. Vaughan,Michael,2008-03-20,11.28,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_Kevin_Johnson,"""Meet Kevin Johnson"" is the 80th television episode of the American Broadcasting Company's (ABC's) Lost and the eighth episode of the fourth season. It was written in October and November 2007 by supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and co-producer Brian K. Vaughan, and directed in November by co-executive producer Stephen Williams.[2] ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" first aired March 20, 2008, on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada.[3] In the second-season finale, after 67 days of being stranded on a mysterious and mystical tropical island, Oceanic Airlines 815 crash survivor Michael Dawson (played by Harold Perrineau) successfully negotiates his escape via motorboat with the island's dangerous original inhabitants, whom the survivors refer to as the ""Others"". One month later in the episode before ""Meet Kevin Johnson"", Michael reappears on a freighter offshore of the island, undercover with the alias ""Kevin Johnson"". Most of the narrative of ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" consists of a continuous flashback—the third longest in the show's history after ""Across the Sea"" and ""The Other 48 Days""—showing what happened to Michael in the month that he spent away in New York and on the freighter, primarily his recruitment aboard the freighter Kahana as a spy for the Others. The writers completed ""Meet Kevin Johnson"", the eighth of 16 ordered scripts, on the same day that the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike action began. Post-production finished weeks later without input from the show's writers. ABC pledged to air the completed eight episodes regardless of the strike's resolution, but the writers felt that the episode's cliffhanger was unsuitable as a potential season finale. ABC ultimately overruled their opposition. ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" was watched by 13 million Americans and was met with mixed reactions. A major discussion point was the episode's climax, which was criticized for its placement in the story and its focus on secondary characters. Although critics responded well to Michael's emotional journey, they complained that his physical journey seemed to conflict with Lost's timeline that had been laid out in previous episodes. The episode was honored with the fourth season's sole Primetime Emmy Award for its achievement in sound mixing. The episode's opening is set on December 26, 2004, over three months after the crash of Oceanic 815. Sayid and Desmond are on the freighter ""Kahana,"" moored offshore of the island where the plane crashed. The freighter is owned by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), who is intent on extracting the Others' leader Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). Captain Gault (Grant Bowler) stops two crewmembers from deserting the freighter in a raft. He publicly beats them and shouts that this is to save their lives, reminding the crew of what happened to George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) when he left the boat. The next morning, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) confronts Michael about his motivations, and the narrative shifts into an uninterrupted flashback of Michael's life after escaping from the island. Michael and his son Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley) return to New York. Overcome with guilt, Michael confesses that he murdered Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby (Cynthia Watros) as part of his rescue of Walt from the Others' captivity. Michael becomes estranged from Walt, who goes to live with Michael's mother (Starletta DuPois). Michael is haunted by apparitions and nightmares of the late Libby. Michael attempts to kill himself in a car crash, but fails. He sells the watch that Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) gave him in the first-season finale and buys a gun for another suicide attempt, but this, too, is unsuccessful, because the gun jams. That night, Michael is confronted by Tom (M.C. Gainey), the Other who abducted Walt. Tom explains that the island will not allow Michael to kill himself, and gives Michael an assignment: Michael must infiltrate the freighter Kahana using the pseudonym ""Kevin Johnson"" and kill everyone on board, who may try to kill his fellow crash survivors. Michael agrees to do it and boards the freighter from Fiji. Michael becomes acquainted with the crew and hesitates to sabotage their mission until he finds Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and his associates target-practicing with machine guns. After Michael tries to detonate a provided bomb only to discover that it is a fake, Ben contacts Michael by radio and explains that the trick illustrated his stance against killing innocent people in his war against Widmore. The flashback ends and Sayid, appalled by Michael's association with Ben, exposes his duplicity to Gault. On the island in the Others' abandoned Barracks where some of the survivors have taken residence, 815 survivor John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) meets with his faction to discuss the freighter and Ben reveals that Michael is spying for him there. Ben later urges his adopted daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde) to flee to the Others' sanctuary at the ""Temple"" for safety; she is accompanied by her biological mother Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) and boyfriend Karl (Blake Bashoff). On their way, Karl and Rousseau are shot dead by hidden assailants and Alex surrenders. ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" features the first appearance of Cynthia Watros as Libby in Lost since the character was murdered in the second season. Despite a promise by writer's assistant Matt Ragghianti that there would be an episode in the second season in which flashbacks would focus on Libby,[4] Watros became the first main cast member to never play the central role in a Lost episode. Following Libby's death, Co-creator/executive producer/writer Damon Lindelof revealed plans to tell her story in the third season.[5] Libby's story was later postponed again—Lindelof stated that her back story would be told through flashbacks of a new character introduced in the fourth season.[6] Executive producer/writer Carlton Cuse further explained that these flashbacks would unfold over multiple episodes.[7] This failed to materialize; however, Watros made a couple of appearances via hallucinations in Michael's flashbacks in ""Meet Kevin Johnson"". The writers asserted that while they had yet to shed light on the character's past, they would finally in their fifth year.[8] The writers later made further revisions, with Cuse concluding that Libby's part in the show is ""pretty much finished.""[9] When Watros returned to Lost for ""Meet Kevin Johnson"", she did not receive the ""special guest star"" credit, as was customary for former main cast members of Lost. She was instead billed simply as a guest star, although her name appeared with that of frequent guest star M.C. Gainey ahead of the remainder of the episode's guest cast, who were listed alphabetically on-screen. Gainey explained that ""just because they kill you on this show, don't mean they don't need you anymore 'cause everybody's got a past.""[10] Damon Lindelof said that ""it was sort of like a walk down memory lane for the dead"", as it not only included Tom and Libby, but also Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) and George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens), two characters from the freighter who had met their demises earlier in the season.[10] First season regular cast member Malcolm David Kelley returned in an uncredited cameo for a single scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger;[11] however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season.[12] Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did not appear in the cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of Time Out stated that ""You gotta hand it to the Lost writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt's inevitable pubescence. See, the show's set in 2004, and only a few months have passed since the plane crash. Yet … it's been years, and … Kelley has become a man. So what did they do? … They just didn't show him. Clever.""[13]TMZ's Daniel thought that ""Not showing Walt is a clever way to cover up the fact that he [is] a foot taller than he should be … I understand that they pretty much can't show Walt ever again"".[14]Wizard's Nikki Stafford went so far as to remark that ""That kid standing in the window was definitely not Malcolm David Kelley … I don't think Kelley will be back to reprise the role.""[15] Having appeared in six episodes of the third season and the first two of the fourth season, Blake Bashoff auditioned for and won the part of Moritz Stiefel in the Broadway musical Spring Awakening.[16] He warned Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse that he would be unable to shoot Lost for at least six months beginning in December 2007, as he rehearsed for and performed in the production. Being ""big fans"" of the musical and congratulating Bashoff on what they thought was an ""amazing opportunity,"" they brainstormed ideas with the other writers to write him out of the story while they still had him at their disposal.[17] Having decided some time ago that Karl would eventually die, they pinpointed the episode. The cliffhanger of ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" sees Karl shot dead by unseen killers in the jungle. Two episodes later, the character Miles Straume (Ken Leung) finds Karl partially buried in the jungle dirt, but this corpse is portrayed by a body double and not Bashoff. According to Bashoff, the writers hope that he can return to Lost at some point to ""serve a cool purpose like [Tom does in 'Meet Kevin Johnson'].""[17] In regard to his experience with Lost, Bashoff recounted that ""I love the show. [The cast]'s a great group … and … you get to shoot in paradise""; however, he wished that he had learned more about Karl's backstory.[17] The Writers Guild of America went on strike on November 4, 2007[18]—the day that the writers finished editing the final draft of the script of ""Meet Kevin Johnson"".[19] The writers wanted to hold the eight episodes until they were able to produce more of the season because the eighth episode has a ""very cool"" yet inconclusive cliffhanger that was not written to end the season;[20][21] they compared it to ""the end of an exciting book chapter [but] not the end of the novel.""[22] ABC decided that the eight episodes would be aired from January to March, regardless of whether any more episodes were produced in the 2007–2008 season.[23] After the strike's end on February 12, 2008, the writers pleaded with ABC to air ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" on April 17 with the second pod of episodes, due to ""the eighth episode [being] non-traditional and the start of something new"".[24][25]Jorge Garcia, who plays Hurley Reyes, agreed that ""it's a pretty shocking end but it doesn't close out the way our previous [finales] have ended [because] it doesn't have that closure to it [and] ends in a sense of dissonance.""[26] ABC nevertheless prioritized scheduling Grey's Anatomy, Ugly Betty and Lost's returns all for April 24.[27] Despite the struggles with the strike, co-executive producer/staff writer Adam Horowitz recounted this as ""a satisfying episode to work on—it was like we'd been waiting so long to tell the story of what happened with Michael.""[28] Carlton Cuse stated that ""we [the writers] felt that the audience deserved to know, you know, once he and Walt sailed off in the boat, what was their journey.""[10] Supervising producer/writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that ""Michael's goal—the whole season—is to die and he gets an opportunity to redeem himself when [Tom] finds him.""[10] Co-executive producer/staff writer Edward Kitsis added that ""It's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn't see [Michael] … I always respected the fact that he told his son about the murders … Even though he knew it would probably blow up their relationship, he wanted to be honest with his son. In a way, you've got to respect that.""[28] Harold Perrineau, who plays Michael, concluded that ""He's done some bad things and he's you know, got himself into a messy situation, but at the end of the day, Michael's a good guy.""[10] Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot, the flashbacks of ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" are presented continuously and are only bookended by present-day scenes. This is the second episode to do this after ""Flashes Before Your Eyes"" from the third season. The flashback portion of ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" is the longest in Lost history;[29] Horowitz stated that ""As we were breaking the story, it just happened, and it turned into the longest flashback to date.""[28] When asked why Michael's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure, as with other Lost characters,[30] Damon Lindelof explained that ""if the Others … had chosen … Darwin or … Dickens, then … Widmore would have gotten suspicious: he'd go like, 'oh, now there's somebody on my boat with a literary allusion in their name, which sounds very much like that's a Benjamin Linus alias', so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could, which was Kevin Johnson.""[31] Lindelof also said that it was a coincidence that ""Kevin Johnson"" was also the name of an American basketball player.[31] In ""Meet Kevin Johnson"", Michael visits Tom's penthouse suite, where Tom and his lover Arturo (Francesco Simone) are revealed to be homosexual—Lost's only gay characters. Online speculation about Tom's sexual orientation began after the broadcast of the third-season premiere, in which Tom tells Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) that she is ""not [his] type"".[32][33][34] A few weeks later, the writers hinted that a character would eventually be revealed as gay.[35] In response to the internet community's suspicions,[36][37] actor M.C. Gainey began to play the character as such, subtly trying to flirt with Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and later claiming that this attraction ""got [him] through the first half of the season.""[38] Following the broadcast of ""Meet Kevin Johnson"", Lindelof and Cuse confirmed that the line from the third-season premiere is an allusion to Tom's sexuality, but felt that it needed to be explicitly confirmed in the show. Lindelof noted that ""it was not subtle, to say the least"".[31] Edward ""Eddy"" Kitsis stated that ""It was great to see [Tom] and realize that … he is a true gentleman.""[28] M.C. Gainey stated that ""anytime you've got a group of people, somebody's got to be marching to a different drummer—that would be Tom"" and Harold Perrineau rejoiced ""Right on, I thought that was cool"".[10] Tom establishes that the island has some control over whether characters can die, as demonstrated when Michael unsuccessfully attempts to commit suicide three times. Kitsis thought that ""It was interesting what [Tom] said to Michael … that really carries through Michael's arc.""[28] Later in the season, Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) tries to shoot Michael in the head, but the gun jams and the next day,[39] a manifestation of the island in the form of Christian Shephard (John Terry) appears before Michael.[40] Damon Lindelof confirmed that the island's ""cosmic intervention[s] of fate"" also played a part in the car crash that foiled Jack's suicide attempt in the third-season finale.[41] Following the broadcast of the fourth midseason premiere, Lindelof further confirmed that this island force prevents Ben and Widmore from dying.[42] Cuse has said that ""There is a raging debate on the show about what constitutes free will and what constitutes destiny and Michael's story was sort of a[n] argument on the destiny side of that equation. He had more destiny to fulfil with that island than he anticipated and maybe the audience anticipated.""[10] Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that ""the island doesn't let you go until it's done with you and I think that the rest of our characters are going to feel the reverberations of that, as well.""[10] The second scene of the episode has Captain Gault beating two of his men, who had attempted to leave the freighter. Gault's actor Grant Bowler explained that ""it was a scene about how far and fast things were spiralling out of control [on] the freighter … It was also about his ability to run the ship and that he was willing to go to such great lengths to keep order. It was about status, and keeping level-headed, and being in control.""[43] Shooting commenced in early November and concluded on November 27, 2007.[44] The strike suspended the script for the next episode and freed the cast and crew from an immediate deadline, with the result that more time was spent on filming ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" than the average Lost episode. Shooting did not customarily overlap with the surrounding episodes,[45] although it was produced simultaneously with the Lost: Missing Pieces mobisodes directed by executive producer Jack Bender and one scene from the season premiere overseen by co-executive producer Jean Higgins.[46] Perrineau hoped the audience would enjoy Michael's return since the cast and crew ""busted [their] butts doing this one. It felt like we were making a movie because there's so much stuff that happens in this episode"".[47] Lilly called it ""one of the best episodes of the first eight.""[48] The exterior freighter scenes were filmed on an actual freighter, while interior scenes were filmed both on sets and in the freighter.[49] The production crew had intended for the engine room scene where Michael goes to detonate the bomb and sees Libby to be shot in the freighter's engine room; instead, they built a new engine room set based on that inside the freighter. It was ""so stifling hot"" at around 105 °F (41 °C) and the crew found that ""to get air conditioning down [t]here … was an impossible task"", according to the Kahana's real life chief engineer Bob Bower.[50][51] Sculptor Jim Van Houten created twin twenty four foot (seven meter) marine engines for the set, primarily from urethane foam.[51] One New York flashback was filmed on the same Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii street that had been used by set decorator Carol Bayne Kelley as Berlin, Germany in the fourth season's ""The Economist"" and London, England in the third season's ""Flashes Before Your Eyes"".[52] The cliffhanger, in which Alex, Karl and Rousseau are in the jungle, was shot at Dillingham Ranch on the northwest tip of Oahu near the beach where the pilot and other early episodes were primarily filmed.[53] The scene originally ended with ""snipers emerging through the jungle in these incredible, elaborate, jungle camouflage uniforms""; however, this was cut in post-production.[17] Elements of this would be re-shot and used in the next episode when the snipers are identified.[54] Despite picketing on most days with his fellow Lost writers, Carlton Cuse, a member of the WGA negotiating committee, continued to oversee post-production in late November.[55] When negotiations between the Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers broke down in early December, he boycotted his producing duties on the show until the strike was resolved.[56] In addition to Michael Giacchino's original score, ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" contained popular music diegetically. The song playing on Michael's car radio during his first suicide attempt is ""It's Getting Better,"" performed by ""Mama"" Cass Elliot.[57] The song is heard again, fleetingly, during Michael's vision of Libby in the ship's engine room. Elliot's rendition of the song was released as a single in 1969 and was included on her album Bubblegum, Lemonade, and... Something for Mama later the same year.[58]Lost previously played Elliot's ""Make Your Own Kind of Music"" throughout the second season.[59] Dubbed ""the most anticipated Lost [episode] of the season"" by Verne Gay of Newsday due to Michael's flashbacks,[60] ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" was watched live or recorded and watched within five hours of broadcast by 11.461 million viewers in the United States.[61] Despite ranking ninth for the week in television programs with the most viewers,[62] ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" set a new record as the lowest-rated episode in Lost's history,[63] although this title was taken two episodes later with the broadcast of ""Something Nice Back Home"".[64] ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" achieved a fifth-place[65] 4.6/12 in the coveted adults aged eighteen to forty-nine demographic for the week.[66] Including those who watched within seven days of broadcast, the episode was watched by a total of 13.386 million American viewers.[67] 1.421 million Canadians watched ""Meet Kevin Johnson"", making Lost the eighth most-viewed show of the week.[68] The episode brought in 618,000 viewers in Australia, placing it as the twenty-fourth most watched show of the night.[69] Critics and fans alike criticized the writers' seeming disregard for the Lost timeline.[70][71] Based on the actions and whereabouts of characters in the third season, fans could deduce when parts of Michael's flashbacks occurred in relation to events on the island. John Kubicek of BuddyTV wrote that ""This timeline results in some serious issues fans should have with time … This makes almost no sense … Michael left in the boat, he had to find help, come ashore, somehow explain himself, get on a plane back to New York City, drop off Walt to live with his grandma, find an apartment, get into a car accident, recover, and only then did he meet Tom. Either the writers are playing fast and loose with the concept of time, or Michael had the busiest week in the history of the world.""[72] Using Lostpedia as a reference, Nikki Stafford of Wizard pointed out that the chronology was not only almost inconsistent with the third season, but also with an earlier episode of the same season.[15] Damon Lindelof responded that ""we [the writers and producers] find that the [fan message] boards can be really toxic"" and pointed specifically to the ""nitpick[ing]"" of the possible continuity issues of ""Meet Kevin Johnson"", saying in defence of the script that ""it's television.""[73] The cliffhanger, in which Rousseau and Karl are killed and Alex calls out in desperation that she is Ben's daughter, gained a mixed response.[74][75] In an 8.8 out of 10 review, IGN's Chris Carabott called the scene ""completely out of place … tacked on and anticlimactic"" as it ""came at the strangest moment"".[76] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post deemed the cliffhanger ""a shocker""; he asked ""do we really care [about Karl's death]? I mean, he did have a nice new haircut and all, but he really wasn't too interesting of a character.""[77] Despite his assessment that ""this impressive episode was a fitting midseason finale"", Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones wrote that the ""climax wasn't as effective as one could have hoped for, as the collective fates of Alex, Danielle and the ultra-expendable Karl don't rouse a great deal of interest.""[78] Grading the episode as a ""B"", Entertainment Weekly's Jeff Jensen was also unimpressed with the cliffhanger and the characters carrying it; he felt that network executives were partially to blame for going against the wish of the show's creative team to broadcast ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" as a midseason premiere as opposed to a midseason finale. Jensen criticized the episode's unique flashback format, commenting that it lacked the usual ""deeper, more immersive experience [that] embellishes the sophistication of the storytelling"" of Lost.[79] ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" had a share of good reviews, with critics acclaiming Michael's character development and emotional struggles. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found this ""middle chapter"" to be ""quite good"" with ""a fine performance from Mr. Perrineau"".[70] Sepinwall wrote that Michael's ""struggle to deal with the guilt from his Faustian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that's happened before.""[70] The San Francisco Chronicle's Tim Goodman echoed this praise and referred to ""Gay Tom"" as ""a unique and funny twist"".[80] Cynthia Littleton of Variety wrote that ""Perrineau plays it just right most of the time—no hysterics or scenery-chewing, just a man trying to do the right thing, most of the time.""[81] In a four-out-of-five-star review, Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones lauded the lack of interruption to the flashback and commented that ""[Michael's] suicidal plight was well conveyed and there were plenty of shocks and thrills along the way"".[78] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal enjoyed seeing dead characters in flashbacks and commended Perrineau's performance and character's story, while criticizing the underutilization of the rest of the main cast.[82] In an overall positive review for the episode, The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter had mixed feelings for the revelation of Tom's sexual orientation, writing that ""It seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal … not over-the-top gay character.""[77] The episode was also subject to less favorable reviews from critics who were disappointed with the gaps in Michael and Walt's story. Steve Heisler of Time Out ""wasn't all-too-pleased"", citing the story's predictability.[13] TMZ's Daniel called ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" ""solid, but not spectacular"" and gave it a grade of a ""C+"", writing that ""this episode fell a little short … I feel like we were kind of robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. It was interesting to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that we missed a good opportunity"". He further commented that ""Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome.""[14]TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking ""What was their cover story when they got back to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that.""[83] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season;[84] his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback ""essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more.""[75] The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences granted sound production mixer Robert ""Bobby"" Anderson and re-recording mixers Frank Morrone and Scott Weber a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One-Hour) for their work on this episode. On September 13, 2008, the nomination prevailed and became Lost's only Primetime Emmy Award win in 2008.[85] Anderson discussed his job for an Easter egg featurette on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of Lost: The Complete Fourth Season – The Expanded Experience. Lost is sometimes filmed just two hundred yards (180 meters) from the Kamehameha Highway and the traffic noise drowns out filmed dialogue, as do the ocean waves, so Anderson has the actors loop their relatively quiet lines on an automated dialogue replacement (ADR) sound stage.[86]",4435,8.5
The Shape of Things to Come,4,9,Jack Bender,Brian K. Vaughan & Drew Goddard,Ben,2008-04-24,12.33,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shape_of_Things_to_Come_(Lost),"""The Shape of Things to Come"" is the 81st episode of the American Broadcasting Company's Lost and is the ninth episode of the fourth season. It aired on April 24, 2008 on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada.[2] The episode was written by co-executive producer Drew Goddard and co-producer Brian K. Vaughan in late February 2008 and directed by executive producer Jack Bender in mid-March.[3] The narrative centers on Ben Linus (played by Michael Emerson) as he and the Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 crash survivors at the Barracks come under attack in December 2004, while flashforwards to late 2005 show him recruiting Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) as a hitman and confronting his enemy Charles Widmore (Alan Dale). ""The Shape of Things to Come"" is one of a few Lost episodes to contain footage filmed outside Hawaii. The episode aired as the first of the second batch of fourth-season episodes that were originally planned to air uninterrupted by a hiatus with the rest of the season; however, the 100-day 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike paused production and caused the writers to condense the second half of the season, which aired after a four-week break.[4] ""The Shape of Things to Come"" received positive critical reviews, and the original broadcast in the United States was viewed by 14 million people. Much praise was directed at Emerson's acting skills, particularly in his reaction to the execution of his character's daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde). His performance in this specific episode received a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards; the episode was also nominated in the category of Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.[5] The episode is set on December 27, 2004, the survivors' 97th day on the island. At the beach camp, the corpse of Dr. Ray (Marc Vann), the freighter Kahana's doctor, washes ashore. Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) calls the freighter and asks what happened to Ray via morse code. Daniel lies about the response, saying that rescue helicopters will be sent soon; however, Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) calls him out on this and correctly interprets the freighter's message: ""What are you talking about? The doctor is fine."" Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), who suffers from stomach pains throughout the day, forces Daniel to reveal that it was never their intention to rescue the survivors. Meanwhile, Alex is captured by Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and others from the freighter.[6] As they take her to the Barracks, she sets off an alarm heralding the arrival of Ben's enemies. Ben, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) fortify Ben's house, while James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) goes to retrieve the other survivors in the Barracks. He is partially successful, as he saves Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) from her exploded and burning house, but three survivors (portrayed by extras) are shot to death by the mercenaries. Keamy finds and frees Miles Straume (Ken Leung), giving him a walkie-talkie to take to Ben. Ben communicates with Keamy, who threatens to kill Alex if Ben does not surrender. Ben attempts to negotiate and is shocked when Keamy executes Alex. Locking himself in the house's secret room, Ben enters a hidden chamber. He re-emerges shortly after covered in soot, and the smoke monster attacks Keamy's henchmen. The survivors flee for the forest, with Ben lingering briefly to grieve over Alex's body. Afterward, Ben and Locke depart to locate Jacob for further instructions. Sawyer, Hurley, Claire and Aaron turn to return to the beach with Miles, but Locke holds them at gunpoint, successfully demanding that Hurley goes with him (as he has found Jacob's cabin before).[7] Flashforwards show Ben on three continents in autumn 2005. Ben is startled when he wakes up in the Sahara Desert wearing a winter jacket and with a large cut on his upper arm; challenged by two armed locals, he kills one of them (Nick Hermz) and knocks the other (Sammy Sheik) unconscious and travels on horseback to Tozeur, Tunisia on October 24, 2005. Ben journeys to Tikrit, Iraq, where the funeral of Sayid's wife Nadia Jazeem (Andrea Gabriel) is taking place. Ben tells Sayid that Widmore ordered Ishmael Bakir (Faran Tahir) to kill Nadia. Ben lures Bakir into a trap to be killed by Sayid, who shoots Bakir repeatedly. Ben recruits him to become his assassin, and leaves for London, where he breaks into Widmore's penthouse; although he cannot kill Widmore, he states that he is going to kill Widmore's daughter Penelope (Sonya Walger) in retribution for Alex's death. In their conversation, Widmore claims that the island is his and that he will take it back from Ben one day. The Writers Guild of America went on strike on November 4, 2007,[8] by which time only eight of the planned sixteen episodes of Lost's fourth season had been written.[9] These episodes aired from January to March 2008.[10] After the strike ended on February 12, 2008, the writers found that there was only enough time to produce five episodes, although the fifth episode would later be expanded to two episodes[11]—and they proceeded to compress most of the storylines of the planned eight episodes into six,[12] with some carrying over into the fifth season.[13] Executive producer/head writer Damon Lindelof stated that ""we are going to execute our full story plan for season four. This simply requires a shift from high-octane storytelling to superhigh-octane storytelling. It requires no cramming, only a slightly heavier foot on the gas pedal ... so, hold on to your hats. Those of you waiting for the long-anticipated [Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim)] and Hurley Ping-Pong tournament, however, will be very disappointed.""[14] The writers expressed interest to air the eighth episode with the second batch of episodes,[15] but ABC did not comply and ""The Shape of Things to Come"" served as the mid-season premiere. The writers realized some advantages to the strike: they were able to use actors whose shows had been canceled during the strike, and they were able to respond to confusion from the audience.[16] They would later even conclude that the season was better as a result of the interruption, as they were able to discard ""languid, contemplative material"" and felt ""recharged [with] a real energy to attack [the] last six episodes"".[17] The first three seasons were broadcast on Wednesdays in the United States and Canada;[18] the pre-strike fourth-season episodes aired on Thursdays at 9:00 p.m., a time slot normally occupied by Grey's Anatomy.[19] ""The Shape of Things to Come"" and the following three episodes were broadcast on Thursdays at 10:00 p.m., after Grey's Anatomy.[20] ""The Shape of Things to Come"" was written alongside ""Something Nice Back Home"" and ""Cabin Fever"" in February and March 2008.[13] Its title is derived from the 1933 science fiction novel of the same name by H.G. Wells.[21] Co-executive producer/writer Drew Goddard called the episode ""maybe my favorite thing I've done on Lost, and I've been lucky with all the episodes I've gotten so far"".[22] Shooting began on March 10 and continued through March 25,[23] alongside filming of ""Something Nice Back Home"".[24] The scene in which Ben confronts Widmore was actually filmed in London, because actor Alan Dale was unable to fly to Hawaii as he had been appearing in a production of the play Spamalot. Several crew members and Michael Emerson flew to London to film the scene.[21] A scene in which Claire has a prophetic vision was produced; however, it was cut due to runtime constraints.[25] A shoot-out early in the episode sees the end of the three background survivors who joined Locke in his trip to the Barracks in the early fourth season. One of them, Doug, was played by Sean Douglas Hoban, who received credit as a co-star for the first time in his run on the show, having been cast in the pilot as ""Passenger #4"". Hoban later also acted as a stunt double for Dominic Monaghan, who plays Charlie Pace, a major character in the first three seasons.[26] Hoban has one line in ""The Shape of Things to Come"", and he had to audition for it against the other background actors.[27] The episode's flashforwards commence with Ben waking up alarmed in the Sahara with a wounded right arm and vapor rising from him. The Dharma Initiative parka that he wears was codenamed ""Dharka"" by the writers.[28] A couple of Easter eggs are present in this scene:[29] Ben's parka has a name tag that indicates that it was formerly owned by Edgar Halliwax (François Chau) and it displays the first appearance of the logo for a Dharma station called the ""Orchid"" that would not be seen until the episode titled ""There's No Place Like Home"".[30] Another Easter egg is glimpsed in the next scene, when Ben reveals his forged Canadian passport previously seen in ""The Economist"" for his alias Dean Moriarty,[31] which is also the name of the central character in Jack Kerouac's 1951 novel On the Road.[32] Among the most frequent questions that the writers are asked is whether they have planned out future storylines,[33] so the writers try to allude to future plot points, such as with the Dharka scene, that they can later call on as proof that they do know where the story is headed.[21] Director Jack Bender described the scene, which was filmed in a Hawaiian rock quarry, as especially hard to shoot because the actors had to ride horses and use guns, the crew had to relocate due to rocks present that were unsuitable for the scene, and Bender walked head-first into a crane.[34] Emerson stated that the set is ""definitely a no-glamour zone ... I thought we would ease into things. Instead, I get this all-Ben extravaganza: combat, riding horses, foreign languages. And piano playing! All waaaay outside my comfort zone. How can you work two weeks and feel like you need a vacation already?""[35] ""The Shape of Things to Come"" was viewed in the United States live or within five hours of broadcast by 12.075 million people,[36] ranking Lost as the fourteenth most watched program of the week.[37] A total in the United States of 14.067 million people watched the episode live or within seven days; this number was factored into the season's average.[36] This was an improvement over the previous Lost episode that had aired six weeks earlier. Lost also improved its Canadian ratings with 1.443 million viewers.[38] In Australia, ""The Shape of Things to Come"" was watched by only 683,000 viewers,[39] but Lost was nominated in the same week for two Sun-Herald Bogie Awards—a parody of the Australian Logie Awards—in the categories of ""Most Underrated"" series and ""Most Jerked Around by the Networks"".[40][41] ""The Shape of Things to Come"" received critical acclaim. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune gave ""The Shape of Things to Come"" an ""A+.""[42] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly called ""The Shape of Things to Come"" ""one of those deliciously dense episodes in which the nourishment of revelation is mixed with huge chunks of sugary intrigue"" and speculated that the scene in which Alex is executed will be ""sitting very high on this ranking of all-time pivotal Lost moments"" by the series' May 2010 end.[43] Before the season finale aired, Jensen ranked this as the second best moment of the season[44] and put the scene in which the monster attacks the mercenaries in ninth place.[45] Dan Kois and Lane Brown of New York magazine thought that this ""episode didn't exactly feel like the usual moderately paced, secret-revealing drama Lost usually is; it felt like an action movie ... it was like watching Die Hard on an island"".[46] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9.3/10,[47] concluding that ""if 'The Shape of Things to Come' is any indication of the level of quality that [the audience] should expect from here on out then we are in for some incredible storytelling"" and ""Alex's death will probably be remembered as one of the more pivotal scenes in the entire series [because] it is such a phenomenally shot, edited and acted moment ... it would be incredibly hard not to feel for [Ben] here.""[48] Upon grading the best episodes of the first five seasons, the episode ranked second, beating episodes like ""Through the Looking Glass"" and the pilot and losing to ""The Constant.""[49] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad summed up ""The Shape of Things to Come"" as ""a brilliant episode ... [with] tons of action, several big revelations, and more questions to ponder"".[50] Don Williams of BuddyTV decided that the episode was ""worth waiting five weeks for"" and ""so jam packed that I need to give my brain time to rest"".[51] Williams's colleague Oscar Dahl ranked the scene in which Alex is killed as the fifth best moment of the season, noting that ""it was perfectly paced ... and provided a huge shock ... and some of the best acting you'll ever see"".[52] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post wrote that ""'The Shape of Things to Come' was the perfect episode to get everyone back into the swing of Lost. It wasn't a mindfuck à la 'The Constant'. It was an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, which to me matched the 'Pilot''s bombastic grandeur"".[53] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that the episode ""was overflowing with manna from post-strike heaven: lots of action, lots of intrigue [and] the odd answer or three""; however, he criticized the deaths of the three 815 survivors played by extras and survival of main characters, saying that ""that sequence with Sawyer dodging bullets was supposed to be tense and frightening; instead, it was funny"".[54]Kristin Dos Santos of E! agreed with Sepinwall's latter assessment.[55] Jamie Poniewozik of Time worried about the show's direction in which Widmore is suddenly the antagonist and Ben travels the globe to seek revenge. He said that it ""looks a little too much like Alias""; Poniewozik enjoyed the island drama.[56] Daniel of TMZ called ""The Shape of Things to Come"" ""another solid episode of Lost"", grading it as a ""B"" and claiming that ""I enjoyed it the whole way through, even if it never gave me that 'OH MY GOD!!!!' moment, though I loved the Alex execution scene.""[57] Before the episode began shooting, Michael Emerson had already decided to submit his performance in this episode for consideration in the Supporting Actor in a Drama Series category of the Primetime Emmy Awards because of the script's strength.[58] He received his second consecutive Emmy nomination for this role; however, he lost to Željko Ivanek of the FX series Damages. Emerson would win the next year for the episode ""Dead Is Dead"". Kevin Thompson of The Palm Beach Post wrote that ""with those big ol' eyes of his, [Emerson] could always say more with a lengthy stare than he could with twenty pages of dialogue.... [He has], once again, proved why he has become Lost's star as well as its heart and soul.... an Emmy should belong to [him].""[59] Jennifer Godwin of E! wrote that ""no one has ever done better work humanizing a supervillain.""[60] Among those who also praised Emerson's performance as Ben were Robert Bianco of USA Today,[61] Matt Roush of TV Guide,[62] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy, who gave the episode a perfect rating of five stars,[63] John Kubicek of BuddyTV[64] and aforementioned critics from The Star-Ledger,[54]The San Diego Union-Tribune,[42]Time,[56]Entertainment Weekly,[25] IGN[47] and TV Squad.[50]",5206,9
Something Nice Back Home,4,10,Stephen Williams,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Jack,2008-05-01,11.139999999999999,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Nice_Back_Home,"""Something Nice Back Home"" is the tenth episode of the American Broadcasting Company's fourth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 82nd episode overall. It was aired on May 1, 2008, on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada.[2] The episode was written in February and March by co-executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed in March and April by supervising producer Stephen Williams.[3] Critical reviews were mixed and the broadcast of ""Something Nice Back Home"" brought in 13 million American viewers, one of the smallest audiences for an original episode of Lost in the show's history. The narrative begins on December 28, 2004, 98 days after the crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. The leader of the survivors, Jack Shephard (played by Matthew Fox) develops appendicitis and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) operates on him. Meanwhile, James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), Miles Straume (Ken Leung), Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and her baby Aaron continue their trek to the beach from the Barracks. In a flashforward, Jack experiences visions of his deceased father Christian Shephard (John Terry), while his relationship with Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is strained soon after he proposes marriage. Kitsis said that the episode ""was interesting because [it shows] a time, maybe brief, where Jack was happy.""[4] After feeling ill for a day,[5] Jack faints. Juliet diagnoses him with appendicitis and deems an appendectomy necessary. She sends Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim) to get medical supplies from the Staff Dharma Initiative medical station. Sun is accompanied by Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) and Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader); the latter pair are increasingly distrusted by the survivors. Jin realizes that Charlotte is fluent in Korean and confronts her after their successful trip, threatening to hurt Daniel if she continues to lie about her agenda and does not get Sun off the island. Jack convinces Juliet to allow him to remain awake during the surgery, with Kate holding a mirror, so that he can see and direct the surgery. As Juliet operates, Jack's consciousness proves to be a detriment and her nurse—dentist Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson)—knocks him out with chloroform. The appendectomy is a success; afterwards, Juliet tells Kate that Jack really does love Kate and not Juliet. When Kate leaves, Juliet tells Jack that she knows he's awake, after which he opens his eyes. En route back to the beach camp, Sawyer, distrustful of Miles, gives him a ""restraining order"" to keep him away from Claire as they travel to the survivors' beach camp with Claire's infant son, Aaron. On their way, Miles discovers the partially buried bodies of Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) and Karl (Blake Bashoff). They encounter Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), who saves their lives by instructing them to hide from the nearby band of mercenaries led by Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand), who are revealed not to have been killed by the smoke monster in the previous episode. The mercenaries are on their way back to the helicopter to return to the freighter Kahana. At night, Miles watches Claire as she leaves with her deceased father, Christian. Sawyer awakes the next morning to find Aaron alone under a nearby tree and calls out for Claire with no response. In flashforwards, Jack has returned to work as a doctor in Los Angeles. He is engaged to Kate and lives with her while helping to raise Aaron (William Blanchette). Jack visits Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), who is in a mental institution. Hurley has not been taking his medication and suffering from hallucinations of his deceased friend, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan). He believes that the Oceanic Six have died and gone to heaven. Hurley gives Jack a message from Charlie: ""You're not supposed to raise him."" Charlie has also told Hurley that Jack will be receiving a visitor. On two separate occasions, Jack sees his father; Jack asks his colleague Erika Stevenson (April Parker Jones) to prescribe him the anti-anxiety drug clonazepam. After overhearing a phone call, Jack becomes suspicious of Kate. The next night, a heated argument ensues, in which she reveals that she is doing an errand for Sawyer, who Jack says is on the island by choice. Aaron walks into the room as Jack blurts out that Kate and Aaron are not related. The episode was written by March 10, 2008[6] and was done alongside ""The Shape of Things to Come"" and ""Cabin Fever"".[7] Shooting began by March 24,[8] alongside filming of the previous episode[9] and continued through April 4.[10] The flashforwards were written partially to explain what led Jack to become the drug addict that he is in third-season finale's flashforwards, who believes that his father is alive.[11] Matthew Fox stated that the fourth season is ""starting to close the loop on the end of [the third] season. Jack in the future is a man marked by weakness, but the Jack [on the island in December 2004] is strong. ['Something Nice Back Home' explains] how he made that transition.""[12] When asked why Hurley does not take drugs to see Charlie, but Jack starts his drug addiction to try not to see Christian, Edward Kitsis said that ""Jack has … always been a man of science, and there has to be something logical. The scene where Jack is staring at the bench where Hurley sits when Charlie visits him, I think in that moment he's thinking, my life right now is pretty good, I don't want to end up here."" In regard to the contrast in Kate's character on the island and after the island, Kitsis said that ""you could say [that] motherhood suits her. In the flashforwards … there's a sense of purpose to her, there's some clarity to her. There's so much devotion to that child, and she appears to be such a great mother … taking care of Aaron may have helped her put away some other issues.""[4] ""Something Nice Back Home"" was viewed live or recorded and watched within four hours of broadcast by 10.726 million American viewers,[14] scoring a 4.7/13 in the key adults 18–49 demographic,[15] ranking Lost as the twenty-first most watched series of the week[16] and setting a ratings low for the series.[17] A total of 12.946 million Americans watched the episode live or recorded it and watched it within seven days; this number was factored into the season's average.[18] The episode was viewed by 1.322 million Canadians, making Lost the nineteenth most watched show of the week.[19] 647,000 in the United Kingdom tuned in to the local broadcast.[20] In Australia, ""Something Nice Back Home"" was watched by 505 000 people,[21] having been moved to a later timeslot of 10.30 pm, outside the prime time viewing block.[22] Verne Gay of Newsday described it as ""another fine, fine Lost"".[23]The San Diego Union-Tribune's Karla Peterson gave the episode an ""A"", calling it ""one of those dense, chewy episodes in which a lot of stuff happened to a lot of people, and the foundation was laid for one hell of a season finale."" She praised Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Jorge Garcia, Elizabeth Mitchell and Jeremy Davies's work in ""Something Nice Back Home"",[24] while Tom Iacuzio of The Daytona Beach News-Journal deemed Jeremy Davies's performance deserving of an Emmy Award.[25]The Palm Beach Post's Kevin Thompson ""thought [that] Matthew [Fox] did a nice job conveying a wide range of emotions—scared, haunted, frustration, horny, jealousy, just to name a few.""[26] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said that ""Something Nice Back Home"" ""was partly a transitional passage in the Lost saga, a busywork episode designed to put all the characters in position for the year's big finale""[27] and ""[Jack's] appendicitis [was] the kind of hardcore castaway survival plotline we haven't really seen since season 1. Combined with a strong character-driven flash story, it was very old school Lost.""[28] Jensen also ""liked how the episode neatly neutralized one of [his] least favorite season 4 moments, the Jack-Juliet smooch"".[13]TV Guide's Michael Ausiello wrote that ""Fox quietly solidified his status as one of the tube's most reliable and unshowy stalwarts"" and deemed him deserving of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.[29] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV gave the episode a positive review, saying that he was ""shocked and baffled"" and writing that ""Lost … can give me an exciting, well-done episode while making me fear where the series is going … [because] ghosts aren't my thing.""[30]The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter decided that ""what made this episode great was the fact that it just contained so much story [with] Jack's flashforward [making] this one of his most interesting 'centric' episodes. … Not only was Jack's story interesting for a change, but the inclusion of [many] other characters … and giving them great story and character development [was also intriguing].""[31] Daniel of TMZ graded ""Something Nice Back Home"" as a ""B"". In his recap, he wrote that ""if that's the last we ever see of Claire again, that would be BEYOND awesome.""[32] Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Fox's performance, saying that it was almost worthy of an Emmy Award nomination.[33]The Star-Ledger's Alan Sepinwall gave the episode a mixed review, saying that ""I find [Jack] and his love life simultaneously boring and obnoxious … [and] insufferable""; however, he enjoyed the subplots and commended the acting by Matthew Fox and Jorge Garcia.[34] James Poniewozik of Time did not enjoy the flashforwards, commenting that they were ""the first of the flashforwards that resembled one of the bad old flashbacks, in that it just reconfirmed character traits we already knew and showed Jack and Kate falling into patterns we knew from the past … I didn't get much from it"".[35]IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.5/10, making it his least favorite episode of the season. Carabott wrote that ""this season [Lost's main character Jack] seems to have been relegated to playing second fiddle … oddly enough, even in his own episode, Jack really isn't given much to do"" and stated that ""the possible rekindling of Jack and Kate's romantic relationship on the island is juxtaposed quite well with their relationship during the flashforward.""[36] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that ""the pace … was a bit too slow"" and ""I usually like the Jack-centered episodes, but a bout of appendicitis simply does not make for high drama or stimulating action""; however, he noted that ""all in all, this was a good episode, but it was nothing special.""[37] Compora praised Fox's increasingly good acting, but said that ""this season has seen much stronger lead performances from Michael Emerson [in 'The Shape of Things to Come' as Ben Linus] and Henry Ian Cusick [as Desmond Hume in 'The Constant'].""[38] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad called ""Something Nice Back Home"" ""a break after last week's action- and information-packed episode"", argued that Rousseau was not given a proper death and enjoyed Rose and Bernard's roles.[39]UGO's Sara shared Martell's sentiments in regard to Rose and Bernard's appearances and speculated that ""Something Nice Back Home"" would not be enjoyed by fans who like Rousseau or do not like Jack.[40] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode three out of five stars, saying that ""the Jack-Kate romantic intrigue is rather dull, while the appendix plot feels like an unnecessary narrative obstacle for viewers to surmount.""[41]",4218,8.1
Cabin Fever,4,11,Paul Edwards,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Kyle Pennington,Locke,2008-05-08,11.28,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_Fever_(Lost),"""Cabin Fever"" is the 11th episode of the American Broadcasting Company's fourth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 83rd episode overall. It was aired on May 8, 2008, on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada.[2] The episode was written by supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and Kyle Pennington and directed by Paul Edwards. According to a press release, ""John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is enlightened as to the whereabouts of Jacob's cabin, and life aboard the freighter becomes perilous.""[3] The episode was written alongside ""The Shape of Things to Come"" and ""Something Nice Back Home"".[4] ""Cabin Fever"" was watched by 11 million American viewers. The episode begins with a flashback to 1956, when 16-year-old Emily Locke (Holland Roden) is preparing for a date with a man twice her age. Her mother tries to stop her from going out, but Emily leaves anyway and is struck by a car. The trauma triggers the premature birth of John (as an adult portrayed by Terry O'Quinn). John's life is monitored by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who at John's birth and throughout his childhood looks the same age as he does in present day, and Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick), each of whom attempts to influence his life. The existence of Mittelos Bioscience is revealed when John is invited to spend the summer there as a highly gifted high school student. In the present day, Locke, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) are attempting to find a cabin inhabited by Jacob, the de facto leader of the Others. They are initially unsuccessful, but an apparition of deceased DHARMA Initiative member Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison) assists Locke by pointing him to the Initiative's mass grave. There, Locke extracts a set of blueprints from Horace's jacket, and uses it to locate the cabin. On the freighter Kahana, mercenary Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) returns from his unsuccessful attack on the Barracks, the former home of the Others.[5] Enraged that his mission was unsuccessful and several of his colleagues were killed, he accuses Gault (Grant Bowler) of giving him up to Ben, but Gault tells Keamy that Michael is the actual spy. He tries to kill Michael by shooting him, but just as in ""Meet Kevin Johnson"" when Michael tries to commit suicide, the gun jams. Gault then tells Keamy that Michael is vital to repairing the engines, because he is the one that sabotaged them initially. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), fearing Keamy's intentions, uses a Zodiac boat to return to the island, hoping to save as many people as possible. Desmond refuses to accompany him, saying that he would never return to the island after he left. Several hours after Sayid leaves, Keamy stages a mutiny. A soldier receives a message from the island saying they found the body of ship doctor Ray (Marc Vann) (as shown in ""The Shape of Things to Come""), but the doctor protests that it's impossible since he's alive on the boat. Keamy orders Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) at gunpoint to prepare the freighter's helicopter; Lapidus refuses, and Keamy kills the doctor and Gault in response. Lapidus acquiesces and Keamy leaves the freighter with a group of mercenaries, intending to ""torch the Island"". When the helicopter passes over the survivors' beach camp, Frank drops a bag containing a satellite phone onto the beach. At the end of the episode, Locke enters the cabin alone and meets the figure of the deceased Christian Shephard (John Terry), who claims he is speaking on Jacob's behalf and is accompanied by his daughter Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin). Christian warns Locke that Keamy's mercenaries from the Kahana are already en route to the Island, and that the Island must be moved. ""Cabin Fever"" was the fifth episode to be directed by Paul Edwards. It was the first installment to be written by Kyle Pennington, the eleventh by Elizabeth Sarnoff, and was the first that the two wrote together. Recurring guest star Nestor Carbonell appeared in seven episodes of Lost's third season as Richard Alpert and the mysteries surrounding his ageless character were heavily discussed among the fan community.[6] While producing the final episodes of the third season, Carbonell was cast in a starring role on the new CBS series Cane. The writers modified their original story plan for the third season in anticipation for Carbonell's potential unavailability. Despite Carbonell's willingness to return to Lost, CBS president Nina Tassler ruled out another Lost guest appearance.[7]Cane was canceled during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, freeing Carbonell from his contract with CBS.[8] Executive producer Carlton Cuse cited this as an unintended positive consequence of the strike.[9] ""Cabin Fever"" was viewed live or recorded and watched within five hours of broadcast by 10.78 million American viewers.[10] It attained a 4.7/13 in the key adults 18-49 demographic,[11] ranking Lost as the nineteenth most watched program of the week,[12] two places up from the previous episode, ""Something Nice Back Home"".[13] ""Cabin Fever"" was watched by 392,000 Australian viewers, making Lost the thirty-third most watched program of the night.[14] Robin Abrahams of the Boston Globe published an analysis exploring disability on her blog. A paragraph analyzed the scene where the ""disabled-in-the-eyes-of-others Hurley"" and the ""disabled-in-his-own-mind Ben"" shared a candy bar, which she thought was ""kind of good and ... awful""; she said ""It was great to see the most hateful and most lovable characters sitting on a log sharing a chocolate bar."" However, she thought that the scene did not use its full potential in emphasizing Hurley's empathy and Ben's reaction.[15] However, Kristin Dos Santos of E!, who gave the episode a mostly positive review, was critical of the scene; she thought that the scene wasted time and was ""cruel and unusual punishment"" to air before the cliffhanger ending.[16] Erin Martell from TV Squad stated ""This episode put everyone, including the freighter folk, in place to carry out their plans. I'm already stoked for the finale"".[17]",4380,8.7
There's No Place Like Home (Part 1),4,12,Stephen Williams,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,Jack & Hurley & Sayid & Sun & Kate,2008-05-15,11.4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_No_Place_Like_Home_(Lost),"""There's No Place Like Home, Parts 1, 2 & 3""[A] is the season finale of the American Broadcasting Company's fourth season of the serial drama television series Lost, consisting of the 12th through 14th episodes. They are also the 84th through 86th episodes of the show overall. The three constituent episodes were split into two broadcasts; ""Part 1"" first aired on May 15, 2008, and ""Part 2"", serving as the two-hour season finale of the fourth season, first aired on May 29, 2008, on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada. The episodes were written by executive producers/show runners Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof; ""Part 1"" was directed by co-executive producer Stephen Williams, while executive producer Jack Bender directed ""Part 2"". The episode's title is a reference to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The narrative takes place in late December 2004, 100 days after the crash of Oceanic Flight 815. The survivors of the crash team up with the Others, natives of the island where the plane crashed, to confront the mercenaries from the freighter Kahana, who have come to the island. Following this, some of the survivors escape the island, which is afterwards moved by Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). Flashforwards show the first actions of the Oceanic Six, those who are rescued, after returning home in January 2005, and their lives in late 2007. The cliffhanger from the previous season finale, ""Through the Looking Glass,"" is resolved by revealing John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) to be dead and in the coffin that Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) visits in that episode. Production and broadcast of the fourth season were interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike and following its resolution, the writers were unable to compress the remainder of season four into the five allotted episodes and the season finale was extended by one hour. Subsequently, the production schedule was compressed and post-production work was completed in three weeks, instead of the usual two months. The second part was watched by 12 million Americans, making Lost the most watched show of the week, for the first time in the show's history. Both parts were met with critical acclaim. Matthew Fox's acting in his flashforward scenes was praised, as was Michael Giacchino's musical score. The episode's editing was nominated for both a Primetime Emmy Award and Eddie Award. In flashforwards to January 2005, the Oceanic Six—Jack Shephard, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) infant, Aaron—arrive in Honolulu, where Hurley and Sun are reunited with their parents; Jack with his mother; and Sayid with his girlfriend, Nadia Jaseem (Andrea Gabriel). In the ensuing media circus, a press conference is held, where they lie about everything that has happened on the island; claiming that they are the only living survivors and that Kate gave birth to Aaron on the island. Sometime later, Hurley's dad (Cheech Marin) gives Hurley his newly rebuilt 1970s Camaro, at a surprise birthday party. Hurley, however, becomes panicked and runs away when he notices that the car's odometer displays the numbers. In Seoul, South Korea, Sun visits her father and informs him that she used the money from her settlement with Oceanic Airlines to buy a controlling interest in his company because she blames him for her husband's, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), death. In the final flashforward, Jack eulogizes his deceased father, Christian Shephard (John Terry). After the ceremony, Carole Littleton (Susan Duerden), Claire's mother, reveals to him that Claire is his half-sister; as she walks away, she smiles at Aaron in Kate's arm, oblivious to the fact that she is staring at her grandson. On December 30, 2004, following the events of ""Cabin Fever"", Jack and Kate follow the tracking signal on the phone given to them by Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), who dropped it onto the survivors' beach from a helicopter. They encounter James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), Aaron and Miles Straume (Ken Leung); Kate returns to the beach with Miles and Aaron. Jack and Sawyer meet up with Lapidus at the helicopter, but decide to rescue Hurley, who is with Ben, the mercenaries' target, before leaving for the freighter. Meanwhile, Sayid arrives at the beach on the freighter's Zodiac boat and informs the survivors that they must go to the freighter as soon as possible because the mercenaries' secondary objective is to kill everyone on the island. He and Kate go after Jack and Sawyer, but are captured by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) and the rest of the Others. After unsuccessfully attempting to convince his crush, Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader),[2] to leave the island, Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) starts ferrying people to the freighter. Sun, Jin, and Aaron arrive at the boat, only to discover a bomb, consisting of a large amount of C4 explosives, on board. Meanwhile, in their quest to move the island, Ben, Locke and Hurley arrive at the Dharma Initiative Orchid station, which is disguised as a greenhouse. Ben sends Locke to the real part of the station and surrenders himself to Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and the other mercenaries from the Kahana, who had previously arrived. A final montage shows the Oceanic Six and Ben in their respective predicaments. On the island, Jack and Sawyer meet up with Hurley and Locke at the Orchid station. Jack and Locke once more argue about the nature of the island; Locke implores him to lie about the island once he and the other survivors leave. At the helicopter, Kate, Sayid, and the Others free Ben by ambushing and killing the mercenaries, except Keamy, who feigns death. In return, the Others allow Kate, Sayid and the other survivors to leave the island on the helicopter. Ben returns to the Orchid, where he gets in a hidden elevator with Locke. Inside the underground part of the Orchid station, Ben puts every metal item he can find into a small compartment at the back of the room, while Locke watches the orientation video for the Orchid. On the tape, Pierre Chang (François Chau) begins to discuss time travel involving ""negatively charged exotic matter"" when the VCR malfunctions and the tape rewinds itself. Shortly, Keamy arrives and tells Locke that if he (Keamy) dies, the C4 on the freighter will detonate, due to a remote trigger linked to a heart rate monitor he is wearing. Regardless, Ben kills Keamy with no remorse or sympathy for those on the boat, in order to avenge his adopted daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde), whom Keamy executed. Ben seals and then activates power to the compartment he had loaded with metal items, blowing a hole in the back of it. Ben, now wearing a parka, tells Locke that whoever moves the island is forced to leave it and never come back; Ben must do it so that Locke can stay and lead the Others. Locke then goes to the Others, who welcome him home. Ben climbs through the hole and down a rocky tunnel beyond it into a frozen chamber, cutting his arm in the process. He then turns a very large metal wheel. As he completes the rotation, an eerie sound and white-yellow light soon envelop the entire island. Ben disappears, only to reappear several months later in the Sahara Desert (as seen in ""The Shape of Things to Come"").[3][4] Jack, Kate, Sayid, Sawyer, Hurley, and Frank Lapidus leave the island on the helicopter, but discover a fuel leak on board. In order to lighten the helicopter, Sawyer jumps out after whispering something in Kate's ear and kissing her. The helicopter makes it to the Kahana in the nick of time; they refuel it, fix the leak, pick up Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), Sun and Aaron and leave seconds before the C4 detonates. The resulting explosion kills Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau),[5] who is told that ""he can go now"" by a vision of Christian Shephard. The status of Jin, who is still on the boat, is left uncertain as a cliffhanger. Sawyer swims back to the island and laments the destruction of the boat with Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell). The people on the helicopter decide to return to the island, but as they approach, they see the island vanish in the white-yellow light. With nowhere to land, the helicopter runs out of fuel and the survivors are forced to ditch into the ocean. They drift in a rescue raft for several hours, where Hurley suggests that Locke succeeded in moving the island, but Jack refuses to believe it. Jack convinces the other survivors that they must lie about their experiences on the island, to protect those left behind. That same night, the survivors are rescued by Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger), Desmond's girlfriend, with whom he is finally reunited. In keeping with the faked wreckage of Flight 815 found in the Java Trench, the Oceanic Six are dropped off near the island of Sumba, where they are found by local villagers. In flashforwards to late 2007, following those in ""Through the Looking Glass"", Jack, Kate and Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley) all recount stories of being approached by Jeremy Bentham, the dead man in the coffin. Kate has a dream in which Claire tells her not to bring Aaron back to the island. In London, England, Sun confronts Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Penny's father, who sent the Kahana to the island, and tells him that they have common interests involving the island. After finding out that Bentham is dead, Sayid breaks into the mental hospital where Hurley is staying and convinces him to go ""somewhere safe"". Jack returns to the funeral parlor, where he is confronted by Ben, who says that the island will not allow Jack to return without everyone else who left joining him. This includes Jeremy Bentham's body, who is finally revealed to be John Locke. The episode features the last appearance of actor Harold Perrineau, whose character Michael dies in an explosion, as a main cast member. The character of Michael was absent for the entire third season of Lost and returned midway through the fourth season in ""Ji Yeon."" Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, ""there are all these questions about how [the writers] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting.""[5] The fate of Jin, who is also on the freighter when it explodes, is left uncertain. Actor Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, which prompted speculation about his future on the series, due to co-stars Michelle Rodriguez (Ana-Lucia Cortez) and Cynthia Watros (Libby) leaving Lost after DUI arrests.[6][7][8] This episode also marks Malcolm David Kelley's first appearance on the show since the third season, excepting a computer effects shot of the actor in ""Meet Kevin Johnson"". Kelley's character, Walt, was ""benched"" for the majority of the second and third seasons because the actor's growth was disproportionate to the amount of time that has passed on the island. The writers got the idea to show him in flashforwards in his older form while writing ""Through the Looking Glass"".[4] Throughout season four, Jack and Locke have argued about the true nature of the island, whether it had supernatural powers and on how Oceanic Flight 815 crashing could be part of the survivors' destiny. Upon witnessing the island vanish at the end of this episode, Jack finally realizes that Locke was right.[4] Jack then takes Locke's advice and convinces the other survivors that they must lie about the island once they are rescued. This is further emphasized by the fact that the same music is played during Jack and Locke's conversation and when the survivors encounter Penny's boat. Lindelof has also stated that Sawyer's message to Kate in the helicopter is a ""critical plot point"" in that it ultimately leads to the end of Jack and Kate's relationship once they return home (as seen in ""Something Nice Back Home"").[4] In terms of plot structure, the main action scene of the episode, where the Others and the survivors confront the mercenaries, was deliberately placed at the beginning of ""Part 2"" so that the remainder of the episode could focus on character development. Furthermore, all of the present time plotlines are interconnected by the C4 bomb on the freighter, even though the writers themselves have called the use of the bomb as a plot device ""ridiculous"". It was necessary, however, in order to keep both Michael and Jin from leaving the freighter with the other survivors.[4] The final scenes of the episode, particularly Ben turning the wheel, Penny and Desmond's reunion and the last shot of Locke in the coffin were kept secret, in order to prevent spoilers from leaking. The phrase ""Frozen Donkey Wheel"" was coined to describe not only the wheel that Ben turns, but also the final scene in which Locke is shown to be in the coffin. Only six people knew that Locke was in the coffin—actors Matthew Fox, Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn; writers Lindelof and Cuse and Jack Bender, the director.[4] The Writers Guild of America went on strike on November 4, 2007[9] after the writers had only finished the first eight episodes of the season.[10] Show runners Lindelof and Cuse wanted to hold the eight episodes until they were able to produce more of the season,[11] but ABC decided that the eight episodes would be aired from January to March, regardless of whether any more episodes were produced in the 2007–2008 season.[12] After the resolution of the strike, ABC decided to produce five more episodes for the fourth season. This conflicted with ABC's earlier plan to broadcast seasons four, five and six in uninterrupted blocks of sixteen episodes each.[13] Despite this, ABC prioritized scheduling Grey's Anatomy, Ugly Betty and Lost's returns all for April 24.[14] The decision left the three unproduced episodes of season four ""in the bank"" to be used later in seasons five and six.[15] After the resolution of the strike, Lindelof said that the effect of the strike on the fourth season would be minimal and the season's story arc would be completed as originally intended.[16] However, the first draft of the second part of ""There's No Place Like Home,"" was 85 pages long, approximately 30 pages longer than a typical one hour Lost script. Lindelof and Cuse found that they could not compress the second half of the season finale into one episode and actually wanted to expand it. Subsequently, the show runners went into ""advanced talks"" with executives at ABC and convinced them to produce one of their episodes ""in the bank"", thereby extending ""There's No Place Like Home: Part 2"" to two hours.[17] However, this caused a scheduling problem with Grey's Anatomy and Ugly Betty, which were both already scheduled to air their season finales on May 22, 2008. To allow Lost to have a two-hour finale, ABC moved it one week later to May 29, 2008 and aired both parts of ""There's No Place Like Home"" back-to-back.[18][19][20] Ultimately, this left thirty-four episodes to be split over seasons five and six, which will each have seventeen episodes.[15] Another effect of the strike was that the backstories of the so-called ""freighter folk"", i.e. Faraday, Miles and Charlotte, had to be pushed back to season five. As such, the writers dropped hints to Charlotte's backstory in ""There's No Place Like Home"".[4] ""There's No Place Like Home: Part 2"" was filmed in approximately three and a half weeks; filming concluded three weeks before the episode aired.[4] Scenes set on the exterior of the freighter were shot on an actual freighter named Kahana. Several actors and crew members stayed aboard the freighter while filming ""There's No Place Like Home"", as well as other episodes of the fourth season. Director Jack Bender and several others became seasick after only spending a short time on board. The helicopter featured in several scenes never actually took off from or landed on the Kahana because the rotors were too large and would hit the boat if used.[4] Instead, the rotors were added using digital effects and the helicopter was raised and lowered by a crane onto the deck of the freighter while it was docked. Filming took place during this and the footage was intercut with scenes of Michael dealing with the bomb; thus the helicopter is never seen landing on the freighter.[21] Other scenes set on the helicopter were shot on a soundstage in front of a green screen, where actress Yunjin Kim lost her voice from screaming.[4] Furthermore, the first prop bomb was deemed to be too small and the amount of C4 was doubled, even though the original amount of C4 depicted was sufficient to blow up the freighter.[4] The set for the exterior of the Orchid station was constructed in the Manoa valley on the island of Oahu, near Paradise Park, a defunct tourist attraction, which served as the Dharma Initiative Hydra station in the first few episodes of the third season.[22] The exterior elevator for the Orchid station did not actually move and a camera trick was used to simulate movement.[4] The scene in which Sun confronts Widmore was filmed on location, in London, because actor Alan Dale (Widmore) was appearing as King Arthur in Spamalot there at the time. Dale was not made aware of the plot of the episode, saying that ""the wording, the title and all the headings on the scripts were changed. Only [he] knew they were the Lost scripts, along with the director.""[4][23]Sonya Walger declared that despite being a guest star on the show since the second season's finale, the rescue scene was the first time she had met Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly, as most of her scenes were either only with Henry Ian Cusick or alone.[24] Two alternate endings were shot for the episode in order to minimize the risk of the real ending being leaked. Both versions were shown on Good Morning America on May 30, 2008. In the first alternate ending, Sawyer is in the coffin and in the second, Desmond is in the coffin.[25] Overall, it took four editors approximately three weeks to edit the second part of the finale, which under normal circumstances would take two months.[4] ""There's No Place Like Home: Part 1"" was watched by 10.962 million American viewers, of which 6.391 million were ages 18 to 49, ranking nineteenth for the week in total viewers and eighth among viewers age 18 to 49.[26][27] The episode was watched by 1.296 million Canadian viewers, ranking fifteenth for the week.[28] It was also watched by 914,000 viewers in the United Kingdom[29] and by 464,000 viewers in Australia, making it the thirtieth most watched program of the night, a feat that David Dale of The Sun-Herald thought proved that ""there's hope for the world"".[30] ""There's No Place Like Home: Part 2 "" was watched by 12.303 million American viewers, of which 6.453 million were ages 18 to 49, making it the most watched show of the week overall and in the 18 to 49 demographic.[31][32] It was the first Lost episode to lead the weekly ratings.[33] The episode was watched by 1.448 million Canadian viewers, ranking second for the week.[34] It was also watched by 1.166 million viewers in the United Kingdom[35] and by 603,000 viewers in Australia.[36] Patrick Kevin Day of the Los Angeles Times praised Michael Giacchino's musical score,[37] writing that ""I'm reminded of the heights of emotion this series can evoke.""[38] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post thought that the finale's split and two-week break was ""not cool"", but asked ""how brilliant was Sun's smackdown on her bad daddy?"".[39] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that ""when Lost is at its best … it manages to balance revelations … with great character moments. I don't know that I'd put this one in the pantheon (again, a lot of it was set-up for … [Parts 2 & 3]), but it was definitely in the spirit of what I love about the show.""[40]Kristin dos Santos of E! praised the chemistry between Naveen Andrews and Andrea Gabriel, who play Sayid and Nadia, respectively.[41] Chris Carabott of IGN gave Part 1 of the three-hour finale a 7.9. He commended the music and called it ""a good opening to what should be an exciting season finale""; however, the lack of suspense in favor of set-up was cited as the reason for the modest rating.[42] However, Carabott gave Parts 2 & 3 a perfect 10 review, tying with other perfect-10 episodes such as ""The Constant"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"".

There's No Place Like Home (Parts 2 & 3),4,13,Jack Bender,Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof,Jack & Hurley & Sayid & Sun & Kate,2008-05-29,12.2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_No_Place_Like_Home_(Lost),"""There's No Place Like Home, Parts 1, 2 & 3""[A] is the season finale of the American Broadcasting Company's fourth season of the serial drama television series Lost, consisting of the 12th through 14th episodes. They are also the 84th through 86th episodes of the show overall. The three constituent episodes were split into two broadcasts; ""Part 1"" first aired on May 15, 2008, and ""Part 2"", serving as the two-hour season finale of the fourth season, first aired on May 29, 2008, on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada. The episodes were written by executive producers/show runners Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof; ""Part 1"" was directed by co-executive producer Stephen Williams, while executive producer Jack Bender directed ""Part 2"". The episode's title is a reference to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The narrative takes place in late December 2004, 100 days after the crash of Oceanic Flight 815. The survivors of the crash team up with the Others, natives of the island where the plane crashed, to confront the mercenaries from the freighter Kahana, who have come to the island. Following this, some of the survivors escape the island, which is afterwards moved by Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). Flashforwards show the first actions of the Oceanic Six, those who are rescued, after returning home in January 2005, and their lives in late 2007. The cliffhanger from the previous season finale, ""Through the Looking Glass,"" is resolved by revealing John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) to be dead and in the coffin that Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) visits in that episode. Production and broadcast of the fourth season were interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike and following its resolution, the writers were unable to compress the remainder of season four into the five allotted episodes and the season finale was extended by one hour. Subsequently, the production schedule was compressed and post-production work was completed in three weeks, instead of the usual two months. The second part was watched by 12 million Americans, making Lost the most watched show of the week, for the first time in the show's history. Both parts were met with critical acclaim. Matthew Fox's acting in his flashforward scenes was praised, as was Michael Giacchino's musical score. The episode's editing was nominated for both a Primetime Emmy Award and Eddie Award. In flashforwards to January 2005, the Oceanic Six—Jack Shephard, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) infant, Aaron—arrive in Honolulu, where Hurley and Sun are reunited with their parents; Jack with his mother; and Sayid with his girlfriend, Nadia Jaseem (Andrea Gabriel). In the ensuing media circus, a press conference is held, where they lie about everything that has happened on the island; claiming that they are the only living survivors and that Kate gave birth to Aaron on the island. Sometime later, Hurley's dad (Cheech Marin) gives Hurley his newly rebuilt 1970s Camaro, at a surprise birthday party. Hurley, however, becomes panicked and runs away when he notices that the car's odometer displays the numbers. In Seoul, South Korea, Sun visits her father and informs him that she used the money from her settlement with Oceanic Airlines to buy a controlling interest in his company because she blames him for her husband's, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), death. In the final flashforward, Jack eulogizes his deceased father, Christian Shephard (John Terry). After the ceremony, Carole Littleton (Susan Duerden), Claire's mother, reveals to him that Claire is his half-sister; as she walks away, she smiles at Aaron in Kate's arm, oblivious to the fact that she is staring at her grandson. On December 30, 2004, following the events of ""Cabin Fever"", Jack and Kate follow the tracking signal on the phone given to them by Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), who dropped it onto the survivors' beach from a helicopter. They encounter James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), Aaron and Miles Straume (Ken Leung); Kate returns to the beach with Miles and Aaron. Jack and Sawyer meet up with Lapidus at the helicopter, but decide to rescue Hurley, who is with Ben, the mercenaries' target, before leaving for the freighter. Meanwhile, Sayid arrives at the beach on the freighter's Zodiac boat and informs the survivors that they must go to the freighter as soon as possible because the mercenaries' secondary objective is to kill everyone on the island. He and Kate go after Jack and Sawyer, but are captured by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) and the rest of the Others. After unsuccessfully attempting to convince his crush, Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader),[2] to leave the island, Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) starts ferrying people to the freighter. Sun, Jin, and Aaron arrive at the boat, only to discover a bomb, consisting of a large amount of C4 explosives, on board. Meanwhile, in their quest to move the island, Ben, Locke and Hurley arrive at the Dharma Initiative Orchid station, which is disguised as a greenhouse. Ben sends Locke to the real part of the station and surrenders himself to Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and the other mercenaries from the Kahana, who had previously arrived. A final montage shows the Oceanic Six and Ben in their respective predicaments. On the island, Jack and Sawyer meet up with Hurley and Locke at the Orchid station. Jack and Locke once more argue about the nature of the island; Locke implores him to lie about the island once he and the other survivors leave. At the helicopter, Kate, Sayid, and the Others free Ben by ambushing and killing the mercenaries, except Keamy, who feigns death. In return, the Others allow Kate, Sayid and the other survivors to leave the island on the helicopter. Ben returns to the Orchid, where he gets in a hidden elevator with Locke. Inside the underground part of the Orchid station, Ben puts every metal item he can find into a small compartment at the back of the room, while Locke watches the orientation video for the Orchid. On the tape, Pierre Chang (François Chau) begins to discuss time travel involving ""negatively charged exotic matter"" when the VCR malfunctions and the tape rewinds itself. Shortly, Keamy arrives and tells Locke that if he (Keamy) dies, the C4 on the freighter will detonate, due to a remote trigger linked to a heart rate monitor he is wearing. Regardless, Ben kills Keamy with no remorse or sympathy for those on the boat, in order to avenge his adopted daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde), whom Keamy executed. Ben seals and then activates power to the compartment he had loaded with metal items, blowing a hole in the back of it. Ben, now wearing a parka, tells Locke that whoever moves the island is forced to leave it and never come back; Ben must do it so that Locke can stay and lead the Others. Locke then goes to the Others, who welcome him home. Ben climbs through the hole and down a rocky tunnel beyond it into a frozen chamber, cutting his arm in the process. He then turns a very large metal wheel. As he completes the rotation, an eerie sound and white-yellow light soon envelop the entire island. Ben disappears, only to reappear several months later in the Sahara Desert (as seen in ""The Shape of Things to Come"").[3][4] Jack, Kate, Sayid, Sawyer, Hurley, and Frank Lapidus leave the island on the helicopter, but discover a fuel leak on board. In order to lighten the helicopter, Sawyer jumps out after whispering something in Kate's ear and kissing her. The helicopter makes it to the Kahana in the nick of time; they refuel it, fix the leak, pick up Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), Sun and Aaron and leave seconds before the C4 detonates. The resulting explosion kills Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau),[5] who is told that ""he can go now"" by a vision of Christian Shephard. The status of Jin, who is still on the boat, is left uncertain as a cliffhanger. Sawyer swims back to the island and laments the destruction of the boat with Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell). The people on the helicopter decide to return to the island, but as they approach, they see the island vanish in the white-yellow light. With nowhere to land, the helicopter runs out of fuel and the survivors are forced to ditch into the ocean. They drift in a rescue raft for several hours, where Hurley suggests that Locke succeeded in moving the island, but Jack refuses to believe it. Jack convinces the other survivors that they must lie about their experiences on the island, to protect those left behind. That same night, the survivors are rescued by Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger), Desmond's girlfriend, with whom he is finally reunited. In keeping with the faked wreckage of Flight 815 found in the Java Trench, the Oceanic Six are dropped off near the island of Sumba, where they are found by local villagers. In flashforwards to late 2007, following those in ""Through the Looking Glass"", Jack, Kate and Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley) all recount stories of being approached by Jeremy Bentham, the dead man in the coffin. Kate has a dream in which Claire tells her not to bring Aaron back to the island. In London, England, Sun confronts Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Penny's father, who sent the Kahana to the island, and tells him that they have common interests involving the island. After finding out that Bentham is dead, Sayid breaks into the mental hospital where Hurley is staying and convinces him to go ""somewhere safe"". Jack returns to the funeral parlor, where he is confronted by Ben, who says that the island will not allow Jack to return without everyone else who left joining him. This includes Jeremy Bentham's body, who is finally revealed to be John Locke. The episode features the last appearance of actor Harold Perrineau, whose character Michael dies in an explosion, as a main cast member. The character of Michael was absent for the entire third season of Lost and returned midway through the fourth season in ""Ji Yeon."" Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, ""there are all these questions about how [the writers] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting.""[5] The fate of Jin, who is also on the freighter when it explodes, is left uncertain. Actor Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, which prompted speculation about his future on the series, due to co-stars Michelle Rodriguez (Ana-Lucia Cortez) and Cynthia Watros (Libby) leaving Lost after DUI arrests.[6][7][8] This episode also marks Malcolm David Kelley's first appearance on the show since the third season, excepting a computer effects shot of the actor in ""Meet Kevin Johnson"". Kelley's character, Walt, was ""benched"" for the majority of the second and third seasons because the actor's growth was disproportionate to the amount of time that has passed on the island. The writers got the idea to show him in flashforwards in his older form while writing ""Through the Looking Glass"".[4] Throughout season four, Jack and Locke have argued about the true nature of the island, whether it had supernatural powers and on how Oceanic Flight 815 crashing could be part of the survivors' destiny. Upon witnessing the island vanish at the end of this episode, Jack finally realizes that Locke was right.[4] Jack then takes Locke's advice and convinces the other survivors that they must lie about the island once they are rescued. This is further emphasized by the fact that the same music is played during Jack and Locke's conversation and when the survivors encounter Penny's boat. Lindelof has also stated that Sawyer's message to Kate in the helicopter is a ""critical plot point"" in that it ultimately leads to the end of Jack and Kate's relationship once they return home (as seen in ""Something Nice Back Home"").[4] In terms of plot structure, the main action scene of the episode, where the Others and the survivors confront the mercenaries, was deliberately placed at the beginning of ""Part 2"" so that the remainder of the episode could focus on character development. Furthermore, all of the present time plotlines are interconnected by the C4 bomb on the freighter, even though the writers themselves have called the use of the bomb as a plot device ""ridiculous"". It was necessary, however, in order to keep both Michael and Jin from leaving the freighter with the other survivors.[4] The final scenes of the episode, particularly Ben turning the wheel, Penny and Desmond's reunion and the last shot of Locke in the coffin were kept secret, in order to prevent spoilers from leaking. The phrase ""Frozen Donkey Wheel"" was coined to describe not only the wheel that Ben turns, but also the final scene in which Locke is shown to be in the coffin. Only six people knew that Locke was in the coffin—actors Matthew Fox, Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn; writers Lindelof and Cuse and Jack Bender, the director.[4] The Writers Guild of America went on strike on November 4, 2007[9] after the writers had only finished the first eight episodes of the season.[10] Show runners Lindelof and Cuse wanted to hold the eight episodes until they were able to produce more of the season,[11] but ABC decided that the eight episodes would be aired from January to March, regardless of whether any more episodes were produced in the 2007–2008 season.[12] After the resolution of the strike, ABC decided to produce five more episodes for the fourth season. This conflicted with ABC's earlier plan to broadcast seasons four, five and six in uninterrupted blocks of sixteen episodes each.[13] Despite this, ABC prioritized scheduling Grey's Anatomy, Ugly Betty and Lost's returns all for April 24.[14] The decision left the three unproduced episodes of season four ""in the bank"" to be used later in seasons five and six.[15] After the resolution of the strike, Lindelof said that the effect of the strike on the fourth season would be minimal and the season's story arc would be completed as originally intended.[16] However, the first draft of the second part of ""There's No Place Like Home,"" was 85 pages long, approximately 30 pages longer than a typical one hour Lost script. Lindelof and Cuse found that they could not compress the second half of the season finale into one episode and actually wanted to expand it. Subsequently, the show runners went into ""advanced talks"" with executives at ABC and convinced them to produce one of their episodes ""in the bank"", thereby extending ""There's No Place Like Home: Part 2"" to two hours.[17] However, this caused a scheduling problem with Grey's Anatomy and Ugly Betty, which were both already scheduled to air their season finales on May 22, 2008. To allow Lost to have a two-hour finale, ABC moved it one week later to May 29, 2008 and aired both parts of ""There's No Place Like Home"" back-to-back.[18][19][20] Ultimately, this left thirty-four episodes to be split over seasons five and six, which will each have seventeen episodes.[15] Another effect of the strike was that the backstories of the so-called ""freighter folk"", i.e. Faraday, Miles and Charlotte, had to be pushed back to season five. As such, the writers dropped hints to Charlotte's backstory in ""There's No Place Like Home"".[4] ""There's No Place Like Home: Part 2"" was filmed in approximately three and a half weeks; filming concluded three weeks before the episode aired.[4] Scenes set on the exterior of the freighter were shot on an actual freighter named Kahana. Several actors and crew members stayed aboard the freighter while filming ""There's No Place Like Home"", as well as other episodes of the fourth season. Director Jack Bender and several others became seasick after only spending a short time on board. The helicopter featured in several scenes never actually took off from or landed on the Kahana because the rotors were too large and would hit the boat if used.[4] Instead, the rotors were added using digital effects and the helicopter was raised and lowered by a crane onto the deck of the freighter while it was docked. Filming took place during this and the footage was intercut with scenes of Michael dealing with the bomb; thus the helicopter is never seen landing on the freighter.[21] Other scenes set on the helicopter were shot on a soundstage in front of a green screen, where actress Yunjin Kim lost her voice from screaming.[4] Furthermore, the first prop bomb was deemed to be too small and the amount of C4 was doubled, even though the original amount of C4 depicted was sufficient to blow up the freighter.[4] The set for the exterior of the Orchid station was constructed in the Manoa valley on the island of Oahu, near Paradise Park, a defunct tourist attraction, which served as the Dharma Initiative Hydra station in the first few episodes of the third season.[22] The exterior elevator for the Orchid station did not actually move and a camera trick was used to simulate movement.[4] The scene in which Sun confronts Widmore was filmed on location, in London, because actor Alan Dale (Widmore) was appearing as King Arthur in Spamalot there at the time. Dale was not made aware of the plot of the episode, saying that ""the wording, the title and all the headings on the scripts were changed. Only [he] knew they were the Lost scripts, along with the director.""[4][23]Sonya Walger declared that despite being a guest star on the show since the second season's finale, the rescue scene was the first time she had met Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly, as most of her scenes were either only with Henry Ian Cusick or alone.[24] Two alternate endings were shot for the episode in order to minimize the risk of the real ending being leaked. Both versions were shown on Good Morning America on May 30, 2008. In the first alternate ending, Sawyer is in the coffin and in the second, Desmond is in the coffin.[25] Overall, it took four editors approximately three weeks to edit the second part of the finale, which under normal circumstances would take two months.[4] ""There's No Place Like Home: Part 1"" was watched by 10.962 million American viewers, of which 6.391 million were ages 18 to 49, ranking nineteenth for the week in total viewers and eighth among viewers age 18 to 49.[26][27] The episode was watched by 1.296 million Canadian viewers, ranking fifteenth for the week.[28] It was also watched by 914,000 viewers in the United Kingdom[29] and by 464,000 viewers in Australia, making it the thirtieth most watched program of the night, a feat that David Dale of The Sun-Herald thought proved that ""there's hope for the world"".[30] ""There's No Place Like Home: Part 2 "" was watched by 12.303 million American viewers, of which 6.453 million were ages 18 to 49, making it the most watched show of the week overall and in the 18 to 49 demographic.[31][32] It was the first Lost episode to lead the weekly ratings.[33] The episode was watched by 1.448 million Canadian viewers, ranking second for the week.[34] It was also watched by 1.166 million viewers in the United Kingdom[35] and by 603,000 viewers in Australia.[36] Patrick Kevin Day of the Los Angeles Times praised Michael Giacchino's musical score,[37] writing that ""I'm reminded of the heights of emotion this series can evoke.""[38] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post thought that the finale's split and two-week break was ""not cool"", but asked ""how brilliant was Sun's smackdown on her bad daddy?"".[39] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that ""when Lost is at its best … it manages to balance revelations … with great character moments. I don't know that I'd put this one in the pantheon (again, a lot of it was set-up for … [Parts 2 & 3]), but it was definitely in the spirit of what I love about the show.""[40]Kristin dos Santos of E! praised the chemistry between Naveen Andrews and Andrea Gabriel, who play Sayid and Nadia, respectively.[41] Chris Carabott of IGN gave Part 1 of the three-hour finale a 7.9. He commended the music and called it ""a good opening to what should be an exciting season finale""; however, the lack of suspense in favor of set-up was cited as the reason for the modest rating.[42] However, Carabott gave Parts 2 & 3 a perfect 10 review, tying with other perfect-10 episodes such as ""The Constant"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"". He stated that ""Not a moment is wasted in this brilliantly paced and well-executed conclusion to what has been a fantastic season.""[43] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal called ""Part 1"" ""an excellent setup episode [with] fast pace, important revelations, and nearly a full utilization of the cast"". Compora decided that ""certain characters work much better in very small doses … a little bit of [Hurley] goes a long way [and] it was nice to see Jack featured without completely dominating an episode.""[44] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV summed up Part 1 as ""very good"", but said that the opening flashforward in which the Oceanic Six are reunited with their families was anticlimactic and ""although each flashforward scene had minor and major revelations, it felt patched together and a little sloppy, like Lindelof and Cuse had all this ground to cover in their quest to link all the action up to the final scene of season 3 … That said, the flashforward scenes all played out exceedingly well.""[45] Daniel of TMZ welcomed the return of Richard (on the island) and gave the episode an ""A"", saying that it had ""more than a few fantastic scenes.

Because You Left,5,1,Stephen Williams,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,none,2009-01-21,11.66,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Because_You_Left,"""Because You Left"" is the first episode of the fifth season of the American Broadcasting Company's drama television series Lost. The episode is the 87th episode of the show overall, and was written by executive producers/show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by co-executive producer Stephen Williams. It first aired on January 21, 2009, on ABC in the United States and was simulcast on A in Canada. It aired immediately after a clip-show that recaps the first four seasons and aired back-to-back with the next episode, ""The Lie"". In 2007, Jack Shephard and Benjamin Linus start their quest to reunite the ""Oceanic 6"". Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes and Sayid Jarrah are ambushed at their safehouse. Sun-Hwa Kwon is confronted by Charles Widmore. Kate Austen and Aaron Littleton flee from their home after being ordered to submit a maternity test. James ""Sawyer"" Ford, Daniel Faraday, Juliet Burke, Charlotte Lewis, Miles Straume, John Locke, and the other survivors of Oceanic 815 left on the island erratically travel through time upon the island's move. ""Because You Left"" averaged 11.347 million viewers in the United States, and received good reviews, praising the writing and the unraveling of new elements. In the late 1970s, when the Dharma Initiative has begun to build stations on the island, Dr. Pierre Chang (François Chau) begins to film the orientation film for the Arrow Station when he is informed of an incident at the construction site of the Orchid Station. Upon arriving there, he realizes that the workers have found the ""unlimited"" energy source that the Dharma Initiative has been looking for, which will enable them to manipulate time. As he leaves the station, he bumps into Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), who is dressed as a Dharma construction worker. On December 30, 2004, following the island being moved in ""There's No Place Like Home"", the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815, the freighter team, and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) begin to erratically jump through time – something Faraday likens to standing on a skipping record – while the Others are unaffected. The first jump takes them to the day when the Beechcraft carrying Mr. Eko's brother crashes onto the island. John Locke is shot in the leg by Ethan Rom (William Mapother), who has not yet met him and therefore does not recognize him. Meanwhile, James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), Juliet, and the freighter team head to the Swan Station in order to determine when they are. A second jump brings the group forward in time to after the destruction of the station, while Locke is approached by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who recognizes Locke and treats his wound. He informs Locke that they will be strangers at their next meeting, and explains that the only way to stop the erratic movements through time is to bring back everyone who has left the island, and to do that Locke will have to die. Another jump brings them to the past, and they find that the Swan station is now intact. Sawyer tries to contact Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who is inside, but Daniel asserts that the past can not be changed, and since Desmond did not know Sawyer already when they first met, Sawyer cannot be successful. No one answers, and everyone heads back to the beach. Daniel stays behind and knocks again, and Desmond emerges dressed in a hazmat suit, thus belying Daniel's original assertion. Daniel tells him that if Desmond's future self and the survivors of 815 make it off the island on the helicopter then he should go to Oxford University and find Daniel's mother, in order to help the survivors. Another jump occurs just before Daniel can give his mother's name. In 2007, back in Los Angeles, two lawyers deliver a court order to Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), demanding a maternity test for her and Aaron, Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) son, whom Kate is raising as her own, but refuse to reveal their client's identity. In London while en route to Los Angeles, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) is confronted by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) at the airport. She tells him that she wants to kill Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson), a desire they seem to have in common. Ben and Jack learn from the TV that Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) has broken out, hindering Ben's plan to reunite the Oceanic Six. After his escape, Hurley and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) go to a safehouse, which has been infiltrated by two armed men. Sayid kills the men, but not before one of them shoots him with two potent drugged darts, knocking him unconscious. Meanwhile, Ben and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) have left the funeral parlor with Locke's body. On a boat in an unknown location, Desmond wakes up, having remembered what Daniel told him, and sets off for Oxford. Following a writing ""mini-camp"" to map out the fifth season,[2] the premiere's script was written and filming began on August 19.[3]Show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse wrote ""Because You Left"", and decided to put in the episode a setup for most elements of season 5, especially time travel. In order to avert implementing the time travel in a confusing way, the exposition of Faraday's theories was rewritten to start earlier and be more specific.[4] While previous seasons had been filmed in high definition, this season premiere was the first Lost episode to be edited in it.[5] Lindelof stated that ""When season five starts, you won't know when or where you are. And the way we tell stories will be different too"", and confirmed that the ""whooshing sound"" effect will continue to be used as the transition for the new storytelling device.[6] When asked if episodes continue to focus on specific and different characters, actor Jorge Garcia, who portrays Hurley Reyes, replied that ""It's not as clear cut as it's been in the past. We don't have the moments where someone stares off into space and then we cut to something that happened in their previous life. They've gone in a slightly different direction as far as how they're telling the story and they're definitely trying to show what's going on with more people in every given episode.""[7] The script included scenes with all the main characters, including Desmond in the ending, because the writers felt that after a long break the audience would like to see every character again. Like the previous three season openers, the opening scene was meant to make viewers ""not supposed to have any sense of where and when we are"". But while the other premieres had the teaser connecting into the main plot of the episode, the writers decided to put a scene that would only return in the fourteenth episode, ""The Variable"". The time flashes were designed in a way that demonstrated both the castaways at the beach and John Locke in the jungle were ""skipping"" to the same time periods,[4] and also to show that time travel was painful for the characters.[8] In regard to what Lindelof described as ""the Zodiac boat with Faraday and the five people that have never spoken a line on show"", executive producer/writer/show runner Carlton Cuse said that ""I'd be a little bit more worried about the non-line speakers than Faraday"", while Lindelof added that ""things are looking up for Faraday"" and ""there is a monsoon coming.""[9] Regarding the background survivors in general, Carlton Cuse has responded that there is ""a very tragic event that happens this season.""[10] According to Lindelof, Neil ""Frogurt"" (Sean Whalen), a background survivor who has appeared solely in the Lost: Missing Pieces mobisodes,[11] ""will rise up this season in the grand tradition of Dr. Arzt [Daniel Roebuck] to let his feelings be known.""[12]Sawyer is shirtless throughout the episode. Cuse jokingly justified as that ""for people who really couldn't grasp the time travel aspects of the show, there would be Sawyer without his shirt on for the entire hour.""[4] His actor, Josh Holloway, kept fit in the summer break before shooting and noted this as ""really disturbing. Coming after a hiatus, that ain't fair!""[13] The fifth season of Lost was promoted with a music video for the song ""You Found Me"" by The Fray intercut with new Lost scenes and the tagline, ""Destiny Calls"".[14] Television critic Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune has deemed the latter an ""endlessly mockable slogan"";[15] Don Williams of BuddyTV gave a more positive review, summing it up as ""a fitting way to describe the upcoming season.""[16] The staff of TV.com ranked the fifth season first on their ""Most Anticipated of Early 2009"" list.[17] Christopher Rosen of The New York Observer went so far as to deem the return of Lost a ""bigge[r] event"" than other happenings in that week, specifically the unveiling of the 81st Academy Awards nominations and the United States presidential inauguration of Barack Obama.[18] ""Because You Left"", as well as the following episode ""The Lie"" averaged 11.347 million viewers in the US,[19] and 1.195 million in the UK.[20] The episode, aired by itself, brought in 405,000 Australian viewers.[21] ""Because You Left"" and ""The Lie"" were uploaded to ABC's media website—ABC Medianet—on December 29, 2008 to be viewed by members of the press for advance reviews attached to limited confidentiality agreements.[22] ""Because You Left"" was first broadcast on January 21, 2009 on ABC in the United States and was simulcast on A in Canada,[23][24] back-to-back with the next episode, ""The Lie"". Before the broadcast was aired ""Lost: Destiny Calls"", a clip-show recapping the first four seasons.[25] It marked Lost's return to its original timeslot on Wednesdays.[26] Reviews were positive. James Poniewozik of Time thought that ""Because You Left"" provided a good balance of characterization and mythology and commended the character of Faraday, partially ""because a perfectly-cast Jeremy Davies has turned him into a likeable, flawed, brusque, slightly-in-over-his-head nebbish-god.""[27] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide stated that the premiere ""offer[s] compelling twists … the foundation is laid for a pivotal penultimate season … it sends the mind reeling and uncorks infinite possibilities.""[28] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that ""it's hard to name a series that is as engaging, surprising and flat-out gorgeous as Lost, or one in which every effort and penny expended seems to be put to shimmering good use. This is an epic big-screen adventure done for the small screen—and done in a way that makes most big-screen versions pale in comparison."" Bianco also commended the characterizations, noting them as realistic and compelling.[29] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune praised the opening sequence, calling it ""really, really great … nerd-tastic for [the] hardcore Lost fan; it's full of shout-outs and callbacks to classic Lost moments and trivia."" She concluded that the premiere is ""quite good"" (three and a half out of four stars) with ""a lot to like"", specifically the expanded screen time for Faraday; however, Ryan expressed difficulty in understanding the use of time (travel) in the show and felt that one to two more viewings were warranted for her to give a better review of that aspect.[30] Verne Gay of Newsday summed up that ""The season's premiere represents pig-in-the-python storytelling—there's so much to work through, so many details, stories, characters and time dimensions to attend to, that after a while this all starts to feel like a very full meal. A bloated feeling may result.""[31] Among other pieces of praise, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle was impressed by the ""parallel plotting"" of the characters on and off the island in different times.[32] Despite deeming the premiere ""riveting"" and the script ""tantalizing as ever"", Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe had a mixed response, for he worried that he would not be able to handle a season's worth of time travel, stating that ""I may be alone in this, and I hope I will be proven wrong, but I expected the solution to ""Lost"" to be more metaphysical, and more original, than simply people being unstuck in time.""[33] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger deemed it ""really good, in terms of keeping the momentum from last season going, servicing the characters and their emotions, and providing an appropriate number of 'Whoa's per hour.""[34] In a three out of four stars review, Thomas Connor of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that ""the time-travel training wheels are coming off—and the path thus far seems blissfully free of the usual stumbling blocks"", due to the previous four seasons of ""baby steps"" that set up the science fiction driven fifth season.[35] Caryn Kunz of the Honolulu Advertiser said that ""This was a great episode to get back into every aspect of our favorite show: relationships, mythology, reunions/cameos, and enough whoa moments to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout.""[36] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly summed up the entirety of the premiere as ""pretty cool"" and ""worth the wait"". He wrote that ""Lost's tradition of opening the year with a killer, capture-the-imagination sequence is honored and upheld, though the thing I loved most was how it was brazenly frank (and engagingly funny) about the heady high-concept conceit that will define the season.""[37] Brian Lowry of Variety concluded that ""Lost … approaches its twists with what appears to be a greater degree of intellectual rigor than almost anything else on primetime. Even when it's difficult to keep track of the myriad connections, a sense lingers that somebody knows—which is strangely reassuring.""[38] Despite being more interested in the romantic aspirations of the show's characters, Jennifer Godwin of E! remarked that ""the Lost mythology is a miracle to behold. It's grandiose, compelling, gaspworthy and, despite what the haters would have you believe, altogether satisfying"".[39] Katherine Nichols of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin enjoyed the opening scene, ""but the rest of it didn't capture [her] as [she] hoped it would"", citing high expectations due to the eight-month hiatus after the fourth-season finale and a possible ""yearning for more character-driven stories over machinations revolving around time travel, however clever they might be.""[40] John Kubicek of BuddyTV said that ""the opening scene itself will leave your mouth wide open and you'll probably forget to close it for a few minutes."" He also wrote the premiere episodes ""are vintage Lost, full of some unbelievable twists and a whole lot of groundwork"".[41] H.T. Strong of Ain't It Cool News said that ""Because You Left"" ""is a corker, aggressively advancing the story in all kinds of directions.""[42]",5131,8.7
The Lie,5,2,Jack Bender,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Hurley,2009-01-21,11.08,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lie_(Lost),"""The Lie"" is the second episode of the fifth season of ABC's science fiction drama television series Lost. The 88th episode of the show overall, ""The Lie"" aired on January 21, 2009, on ABC in the United States, being simulcast on A in Canada. It aired immediately after the previous episode, ""Because You Left"", which itself was preceded by a clip-show that recapped the first four seasons. ""The Lie"" was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, who were named executive producers prior to the start of production on season five; and directed by executive producer Jack Bender. In 2007, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes has trouble concealing the lie of the Oceanic 6. Kate Austen meets Sun-Hwa Kwon. At the island, the survivors come under attack by a large unseen force. The episode received mainly positive reviews from critics, with IGN giving the episode 7.8 out of 10,[2] and The A.V. Club awarded it a B+.[3] On the island, the remaining survivors are back in the past, attempting to start a fire, when they are attacked by a barrage of flaming arrows. Some of the survivors are able to escape, but Neil ""Frogurt"" and a few others are killed, and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) are separated from the group. Lost in the jungle, they are captured by a group of armed military men who demand to know who they are, asserting that the island is theirs. The men are about to cut off Juliet's hand to extract information, when John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) ambushes them, helping Sawyer and Juliet free themselves. In 2007, following the events of ""Because You Left"", Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) part ways, with Ben taking Locke's body to a butcher for safekeeping. Ben tells Jack to collect any personal items he really wants and meet up with him in six hours. Meanwhile, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Aaron Littleton, her adoptive son, have fled their home to escape lawyers demanding a maternity test. They meet up with Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) at a hotel, who implies that Kate should take whatever measures are necessary to protect Aaron. Sun forgives Kate for leaving her husband, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), on the freighter when it exploded (as seen in ""There's No Place Like Home""). Meanwhile, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) are on the run after they are attacked at their safehouse; Hurley drives the unconscious Sayid, who has been hit by two drugged darts, to his parents' house. On the way, Hurley is pulled over by deceased Oceanic Flight 815 survivor and former police officer Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), who gives him advice on how to avoid the real cops. Upon arriving home, Hurley's dad, David (Cheech Marin), covers for them when the police show up and suggests that Hurley take Sayid to the hospital. Hurley refuses, and David ends up taking Sayid to Jack, who is successful in reviving him. At home, Hurley confesses to his mother Carmen that the Oceanic Six have been lying; she believes him, though doesn't understand his disjointed story. Later, Ben unexpectedly shows up at the house and tries to convince Hurley to go with him to meet up with the rest of the Oceanic Six, saying they all want the same thing—to go back to the island. Hurley wavers for a moment, then runs outside and turns himself in to police watching the house, having been advised by Sayid to do the opposite of whatever Ben asks. Later, Ben visits Ms. Hawking (the mysterious woman Desmond met in Flashes Before Your Eyes), who tells him she has found the island and that Ben only has seventy hours to return to it with Locke's corpse and the Oceanic Six. ""The Lie"" was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, who were named executive producers prior to the start of production on season five;[4] and directed by executive producer Jack Bender.[5] When handing out scripts for the attack on the beach, Bender told the crew he and others ""wanted this to be really big and really dramatic"".[6] They used arrows on wires to simulate hitting the fleeing victims, which included Neil Frogurt (Sean Whalen). A stunt double, Kim Koscki, was hired for the scene to stand in for Whalen; he applied anti-burn cream over his face and body for protection, and crew members waited nearby to quickly extinguish the flames once a scene was finished shooting. Due to the abundance of wires, the actors had to be careful when running, or risk tripping over them.[6] ""The Lie"" features the first appearance of main cast member Michelle Rodriguez since the second season episode ""?"".[7] Rodriguez's character, Ana Lucia Cortez, was written to have a one season arc and was subsequently killed off at the end of the second season of Lost.[8] Dressed as a police officer, Ana Lucia's ""ghost"" appears in ""The Lie"", telling Hurley to ""stay away from the cops"".[9] The scene makes use of the Cheap Trick song ""Dream Police"".[10] ""Because You Left"" and ""The Lie"" were uploaded to ABC's Medianet website on December 29, 2008 to be viewed by members of the press for advance reviews attached to limited confidentiality agreements.[11] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide stated that ""[t]he first hour is the stronger of the two"", and that the ""showstopper [is] one of Lost's most electric and intense action scenes ever.""[12] ""The Lie"" aired on January 21, 2009 on ABC in the United States, being simulcast on A in Canada.[13] ""The Lie"", as well as the previous episode, ""Because You Left"" was viewed by 11.347 million in the US,[14] and by 1.195 million in the UK.[15] In Australia, the episode was aired separately to ""Because You Left"" and brought in 516,000 viewers.[16] IGN gave the episode a ""Good"" rating of 7.8 out of 10 and summarized the episode as being ""a much more focused story than 'Because You Left' but in the shadow of the season premiere's revelations and grandeur it is ultimately the weaker of the two. The comedic moments that string together Hurley's journey only go so far and the rest feels a bit too much like filler... If the conclusion of 'The Lie' is any indication though, the outside world may prove to be just as strange as the island.""[2] IGN later ranked ""The Lie"" 84th out of the 115 Lost episodes, writing ""this isn't a terrible episode, but it feels like a bit of a stop-gap, in the midst of a very cool run of episodes. On the Island, we do get to see a pretty cool looking Flaming Arrow attack, that kills the uber-annoying Frogurt, but the encounter the group has at the end with some men dressed as soldiers is just set up for the awesome ""Jughead.""[17] On a similar list, the Los Angeles Times ranked it at number 69, explaining ""this isn't a bad episode. Like most Hurley episodes, it features a lot of very sweet, funny material. But it is a bit of a time killer between two really fantastic hours.""[18]The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating and stated that ""it's enough for me. I don't know about you, but I'm ready to get Lost again.""[3]",4345,8.3
Jughead,5,3,Rod Holcomb,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Paul Zbyszewski,Desmond,2009-01-28,11.07,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jughead_(Lost),"""Jughead"" is the third television episode of the fifth season of ABC's Lost.[2] The 89th episode of the show overall, ""Jughead"" aired on January 28, 2009, on ABC in the United States, being simulcast on A in Canada.[3] The episode was written by co-executive producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and supervising producer Paul Zbyszewski and directed by ""Hearts and Minds"" director Rod Holcomb.[2] In 2007, Desmond Hume searches for a woman who could help the survivors stuck on the island stop the its shifts. On the island, John Locke, James ""Sawyer"" Ford and Juliet Burke try to save Daniel Faraday, Charlotte Lewis and Miles Straume from the Others. The episode opens with a flashback of Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), in the Philippines, searching for a doctor to help his wife Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger), who is giving birth to their son, Charlie. In 2007, Desmond and Penny arrive in London, where Desmond plans to look for Daniel Faraday's (Jeremy Davies) mother, who is believed to be at Oxford University. However, the university has no record of either Faraday, even though Daniel was a professor there. Desmond breaks into Faraday's lab (which he visited during the events of ""The Constant"") and searches it. He meets a janitor who tells him that Faraday conducted experiments on a woman and provides an address for her. At her house, Desmond finds that the woman is in a vegetative state after experiencing temporal disassociation, similar to Desmond's experiences on the freighter (as seen in ""The Constant""). He learns that Penny's father, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), is not only paying her medical expenses, but also funded Daniel's research. Desmond confronts Widmore, who gives him the address of Daniel's mother in Los Angeles. Desmond returns to Penny, who agrees that they must travel to Los Angeles. In 1954, following the events of the previous episode, ""The Lie"", Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) interrogate the two men they have captured. Juliet deduces that they are members of the Others because they can speak Latin. One of the men, who is revealed to be a young Charles Widmore (Tom Connolly), kills the other when he agrees to lead them to Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) and flees to his campsite to warn his people. Locke follows him and meets with Alpert, using Jacob's name and the compass Alpert gave him to gain his trust; however, Alpert is not entirely convinced. Locke tells Alpert to visit him after he is born in 1956 (a visit depicted in the episode ""Cabin Fever"", during which Alpert shows a young Locke the compass). Locke attempts to convince Alpert to show him how to leave the island, but runs out of time as the next time shift jump occurs. At the same time, the freighter team, consisting of Miles Straume (Ken Leung), Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader), and Daniel Faraday, are captured by another group of Others, led by Ellie (Alexandra Krosney). Faraday deduces that the American military has come to the island to test hydrogen bombs, and that the Others are in possession of one. When he convinces Alpert to let him defuse the bomb, Alpert counters and asked Faraday to prove that he is not on a suicide mission to detonate the bomb. Faraday then confesses his love for Charlotte as proof that he will not detonate the bomb on purpose. Ellie leads Faraday to the bomb (the titular Jughead), and after an inspection, he discovers that it is leaking radiation. Faraday immediately advises Ellie that the bomb should be buried and will not go off for at least 50 years, inadvertently revealing that he is from the future. Ellie doesn't believe him, but Juliet and Sawyer shows up and disarm her. The time shift jump occurs once again and the group is safe, but Charlotte suddenly collapses with a nosebleed. ""Jughead"" is the first episode of Lost to be co-written by Paul Zbyszewski, who joined the writing staff prior to the start of production on season five.[4] Elizabeth Mitchell learned as much Latin as she could for the episode. Mitchell said she could not ""just learn it phonetically"", so she spent the ""whole weekend"" trying to learn the language on the phone with a Latin professor.[5] ""Jughead"" was the name of an actual Mark 16 nuclear bomb that was never detonated in the South Pacific. It was scheduled to be detonated in the Castle Yankee series of tests in 1954.[6] The tower where the bomb is hanging was based on designs from the Manhattan project, and the Others' camp uses actual Korean War military tents.[7] 13.009 million American viewers watched the episode's premiere.[8] In Australia, the episode brought in 465,000 viewers, ranking 29th for the night.[9] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a positive review, saying ""almost every scene in this episode contained some sort of surprise, development or unexpected twist"" and praising the use of time travel.[10] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, stating ""'Jughead' went a lot more smoothly, because it was anchored to the one relationship on this show that has real gravitas: Desmond and Penny. I firmly believe that Desmond wants to keep Penny safe, and that any choices he makes to the contrary are made with great reluctance, and only because he’s answering to a higher calling. Desmond can talk about duty and time travel and be credible in a way most other Lost characters never can. And when Desmond’s providing the connective tissue in an episode as tightly plotted and straightforward as 'Jughead,' it helps a great deal.""[11]",4421,8.6
The Little Prince,5,4,Stephen Williams,Brian K. Vaughan & Melinda Hsu Taylor,Kate,2009-02-04,10.98,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince_(Lost),"""The Little Prince"" is the fourth television episode of the fifth season of ABC's Lost.[2] The 90th episode of the show overall, ""The Little Prince"" aired on February 4, 2009, on ABC in the United States, being simulcast on A in Canada.[3] The episode was written by producer Brian K. Vaughan and co-producer Melinda Hsu Taylor and directed by Stephen Williams.[2] In 2007, Kate Austen tries to find out who wants custody of Aaron. Benjamin Linus and Jack Shephard continue their quest to reunite the ""Oceanic Six"". At the island, James ""Sawyer"" Ford and John Locke devise a plan which might possibly stop the time flashes, but encounter hostiles; while Jin-Soo Kwon, revealed to be alive, meets the younger Danielle Rousseau in the past. The episode opens with a flashback of Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) on Penny Widmore's (Sonya Walger) boat, following their rescue in early January 2005. Kate convinces Jack that once returning home that they should claim that Aaron (William Blanchette) is Kate's biological son, while in fact his mother is Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin). In late 2007, Kate leaves Aaron in the care of Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) in order to confront attorney Dan Norton (Tom Irwin), who is pursuing a maternity test for Kate and Aaron. Sun receives a package with a gun and pictures of Ben and Jack. Norton tells Kate that he is going to meet his client later and Kate decides to follow him. Meanwhile, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) meets up with Jack and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) at the hospital. An orderly armed with a tranquilizer gun attacks Sayid, but Sayid overcomes him, and when he finds Kate's address in his wallet he, Ben and Jack suspect Kate is the next target. The three decide to split up, with Jack going after Kate, and Sayid and Ben going to the prison where Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) is being held, following his arrest in ""The Lie"". Jack and Kate follow Norton to a motel where he meets with Claire's mother, Carole (Susan Duerden). Once Norton leaves, Jack confronts Carole, who is only in Los Angeles to collect on a successful suit against Oceanic Airlines and has nothing to do with the maternity test. At the prison, Ben meets with Norton, who is also acting as Hurley's lawyer and is confident that he can have Hurley released the following morning. Ben and Sayid meet up with Jack and Kate, where Kate figures out that Ben has hired Norton to do the maternity test, while Sun, armed with a gun, watches the conversation from a car with Aaron. Following the latest time jump at the end of the previous episode ""Jughead"", Charlotte is still unconscious. She eventually wakes up and the group of her, Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), Miles Straume (Ken Leung), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) leave to travel to the Dharma Initiative Orchid Station, where Locke believes he can find a way to leave the island. During the course of the episode several others begin to show similar symptoms to Charlotte's. Daniel informs them that the nose bleeds may have something to do with one's time spent on the island. This makes no sense to several of the group since Charlotte, who has the worst symptoms, has only been on the island for a few days. The latest time jump has brought the group to November 1, 2004, the day of Aaron's birth, an event that Sawyer witnesses, and the death of Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder). Another time jump brings them to the future. At their beach camp, they find a canoe which they use to paddle to the other side of the island. They are attacked by unknown assailants and another time jump brings them to 1988, in the middle of a storm that caused a French science team's boat led by Robert (Guillaume Dabinpons) and his pregnant wife Danielle Rousseau (Melissa Farman) to run aground on the island. In their emergency raft, the Rousseaus, Montand (Marc Menard), Brenan (Bruno Bruni), Lacombe (Chris Marvin), and Nadine (Alexandra Tabas) find Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) unconscious floating on flotsam from the freighter that exploded in ""There's No Place Like Home"". They land on the island and question Jin after he wakes up. The episode ends with Danielle revealing her identity to a befuddled Jin. ""The Little Prince"" is the first episode of Lost to be co-written by Melinda Hsu Taylor, who joined the writing staff prior to the start of production on season five.[4] The nocturnal ocean scenes were shot in a swimming pool, which had its bottom covered in black plastic. Over ten thousand gallons of water were used to create the storm. The outrigger canoes were made of painted fiberglass, and had their designs based on ancient Hawaiian canoes.[5] The episode gained 12.855 million American viewers.[6] The episode brought in 380,000 viewers in Australia, ranking 33rd for the night.[7] ""The Little Prince"" received mostly positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode a ""B+"", stating ""[...] this episode made good use of Kate at different points on the timeline: showing her now, anxious about losing Aaron, and showing her three years ago on Penny’s boat, prepared to lie for Jack in order to keep Aaron safe, and showing her three years ago on the island, helping Claire bring Aaron into the world. In just a few short scenes, Lost lays the foundation for what that boy means to Kate.""[8]",4170,8.3
This Place Is Death,5,5,Paul Edwards,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Sun & Jin,2009-02-11,9.77,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Place_Is_Death,"""This Place Is Death"" is the fifth television episode of the fifth season of ABC's Lost.[2] The 91st episode of the show overall, ""This Place Is Death"" aired on February 11, 2009, on ABC in the United States, being simulcast on A in Canada.[3] The episode was written by executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by Paul Edwards.[2] In 2007, Jack Shephard and Benjamin Linus try to convince Sun-Hwa Kwon to return to the island. At the island, Jin-Soo Kwon, having survived the freighter explosion, witnesses the downfall of the science expedition. Meanwhile, John Locke and the group continue to initiate their plan, but must do it quickly, especially due to the deteriorating health of Charlotte Lewis. On the island, following the events of the previous episode, ""The Little Prince"", the latest time jump which has brought the survivors to 1988, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and Danielle Rousseau's (Melissa Farman) science team go in search of a radio tower that is broadcasting the Numbers. They are attacked by the smoke monster, which kills Nadine and drags Montand (Marc Menard) into a tunnel that leads to a temple, severing his arm in the process. Robert Rousseau (Guillaume Dabinpons), Brennan (Bruno Bruni, Jr.) and Lacombe follow him into the tunnel, while Jin is able to convince a pregnant Danielle to stay behind. Another time jump brings Jin forward two months in time. He first encounters the recently killed bodies of Brennan and Lacombe. He then witnesses Danielle confronting her lover Robert because she believes that the rest of the team became infected while inside the temple. Each of them has a gun pointed at the other. Robert convinces her that they should lower their weapons, then raises his and pulls the trigger. The gun does not fire, as Danielle had removed the firing pin from it (revealed in Solitary). She shoots him. Danielle also attempts to kill Jin, but another time shift occurs and Jin is reunited with the other survivors: James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), Miles Straume (Ken Leung), Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) and Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies). The group is on their way to the Dharma Initiative Orchid Station, where Locke believes he can find a way to leave the island in his attempt to bring the Oceanic Six back to the island. Several time jumps occur and Charlotte becomes so ill that she must stay behind, with Daniel choosing to stay with her. She tells Jin to keep his wife away from the island, saying ""This place is death."" She tells Locke to look for a well, if the Orchid Station is not there. Later, she confesses to Daniel that she grew up on the island and that before she left a man told her never to come back or she would die; she believes Daniel is that man. She dies shortly thereafter. The other survivors arrive at the location of the Orchid and find the well. Jin tells Locke to tell Sun that he died and gives Locke his wedding ring as proof because he does not want Sun or their child to return to the island. While descending the well, another flash occurs and Locke falls and injures his leg, resulting in an open fracture. Arriving in the frozen chamber with the wheel that Ben used to move the island in ""There's No Place Like Home"", Jack's deceased father, Christian Shephard (John Terry), greets Locke and tells him that he meant for Locke to move the island in the first place. Locke then pushes the wheel and leaves the island. In late 2007, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) confronts Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) during his meeting with Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews). She intends to kill him; however, he reveals to her that Jin is still alive on the island. She reluctantly agrees to go with him and Jack to another location, where he can substantiate his claims. They go to a church, where Ben shows her Jin's wedding ring, which Ben took from Locke as proof that Jin is alive. Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) arrives at the church, in his search for Daniel Faraday's mother. Turns out it's Ms. Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), whom Desmond saw when time-travelling in Flashes Before Your Eyes and whom Ben met earlier. The four go inside the church, where Eloise is disappointed that Ben did not bring the rest of the Oceanic Six. Rebecca Mader, who plays Charlotte, found out that her character would die when she was negotiating contracts in June 2008. When Mader originally started on the show in August 2007, she was only supposed to do eight episodes, but due to the writers strike, she ended up doing twenty. Mader said: ""I was on the show a lot longer than I thought I was going to be. A lot of it has to do with the writers strike. Less episodes in season four meant back stories were compromised for the new people. I think that's why my character carried into season five."" When she found out about her character's death she was ""disappointed"". ""When I got to the end of season four and found out Charlotte had been born on the island, that was huge. So when I found out I was leaving, I was disappointed. Like all things, it's for the best,"" she said.[4] Mader then reprised her role as Charlotte in the season six episodes ""Recon"" and ""The End."" The episode gained 11.862 million American viewers[5] and 415,000 Australian viewers.[6] IGN's Chris Carabott felt Charlotte's death could have been explored further, but as there was so much happening in the episode not enough time was made for her death.[7] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger noted it was Jeremy Davies' portrayal of Faraday's grief that made him care about her death.[8] Cynthia Littleton from Variety said this was one of the few times Charlotte did not annoy her, as she acts as a translator for Jin, ""finally do[ing] something worthwhile"".[9]",4374,8.7
316,5,6,Stephen Williams,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,Jack,2009-02-18,11.27,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/316_(Lost),"""316"" is the sixth television episode of the fifth season of ABC's Lost.[3] The 92nd episode of the show overall, ""316"" aired on February 18, 2009, on ABC in the United States, and was simulcast on A in Canada.[4] The episode was written by showrunners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by Stephen Williams.[3] In 2007, having recruited Sun-Hwa Kwon, Jack Shephard and Benjamin Linus find a way to return to the island. Jack makes a last-ditch effort to recruit the other ""Oceanic 6"" survivors. The episode begins with Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) having returned to the island, three years since they left it in ""There's No Place Like Home"". The narrative then shifts to 46 hours previously where the previous episode, ""This Place is Death"", left off. Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan) takes Jack, Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) to a Dharma Initiative station underneath the church called the Lamp Post, which was used by Dharma to find the island; since the island is constantly moving, they developed a way to predict where it would be at a given time. When Eloise mentions that the group only has 36 hours to get on Ajira Airways Flight 316, a Boeing 737-300, in order to return to the island, Desmond refuses to join them and leaves. Eloise then tells Jack in private that he must bring something that belonged to his father Christian Shephard (John Terry) with him on the flight and also gives him John Locke's (Terry O'Quinn) suicide note. That evening, Jack gets a call informing him that his grandfather Ray (Raymond J. Barry) has attempted to escape his nursing home. The next day, Jack goes to the nursing home and finds an old pair of Christian's shoes and decides to take them with him. Later, Jack returns to his apartment, where he finds Kate waiting for him, in his bed. He asks her where her adoptive son Aaron is, but she refuses to answer. Kate tells Jack that if he wants her to get back to the island, he must never ask her about Aaron. Then they kiss passionately and fall into bed. The next morning, Jack receives a phone call from a severely beaten Ben, who tells Jack that he must go to a butcher shop and retrieve Locke's dead body. Jack does so, putting Christian's shoes on Locke's feet in the process. He also leaves the suicide note in Locke's pocket. At the airport, Jack, Kate, Sun, and Hurley all board Flight 316. Hurley buys up all the remaining seats on the plane, in order to spare the lives of potential passengers. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) also boards the plane, in the custody of Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson). Ben is last to board the plane, which momentarily disquiets Hurley. Also on board is Caesar (Saïd Taghmaoui). Jack asks Ben as to what will happen to the other people on the plane, to which Ben replies: ""Who cares?"", leaving Jack speechless. During the flight, Jack hears the Captain's voice, that Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) is piloting the plane and Frank realizes that they are going back to the island. Jack, who has been given Locke's note by a flight attendant (the note was removed by airport staff when checking the casket), reads the note which says, ""Jack, I wish you had believed me."" The 737 hits turbulence and there is a flash of white light similar to that caused by the time shifts. The first scene replays, following which, Jack, Kate and Hurley are found by Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), who is driving a Dharma van and wearing a Dharma jumpsuit. This episode and ""The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham"" were written at the same time by executive producers Lindelof and Cuse. ""The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham"" was originally meant to be aired first, but the order was switched because they felt it made more sense and was ""cooler"" and ""there is probably some good information to get in '316' before.""[1] 13.161 million American viewers watched the episode's premiere.[5] IGN's Chris Carabott wrote that Frank's return in the episode was shocking, but seemed as though it was meant to be. He opined that: ""The chances of Frank being on that plane are astronomical and the fact that he was supposed to be the pilot of Flight 815 just makes the situation all the more unusual. His appearance in this episode is absurd but after four and a half seasons of Lost it makes perfect sense.""[6] James Yates of the Staten Island Advance wrote that it was ""great"" to see Frank again, as he had missed the character's presence, and hoped he would play a major part upon returning to the island.[7]",4295,8.6
The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham,5,7,Jack Bender,Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof,Locke,2009-02-25,9.82,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_and_Death_of_Jeremy_Bentham,"""The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham"" is the seventh television episode of the fifth season of ABC's Lost.[3] The 93rd episode of the show overall, it aired on February 25, 2009, on ABC in the United States, being simulcast on A in Canada.[4] The episode was written by showrunners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by Jack Bender.[3] John Locke, after stopping the time shifts and being transported to 2007 in the Tunisian Desert, starts his journey as Jeremy Bentham. At the crash site of the Ajira Airways Flight 316, the passengers try to find the identity of an unidentified man. The episode begins an unknown amount of time after the crash of Ajira Airways Flight 316, which took off from Los Angeles in the previous episode, ""316"", and has crashed on the small island where the Dharma Initiative Hydra Station is located. One of the crash survivors, Caesar (Saïd Taghmaoui), searches through Benjamin Linus's (Michael Emerson) old office in the Hydra Station, finding several documents and a sawed-off shotgun. He is interrupted by Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson), who informs him that a man no one remembers seeing on the plane has been found: John Locke (Terry O'Quinn). Locke explains to Ilana that the last thing he remembers is dying. The narrative shifts into an extended flashback of Locke's time off the island, since he left it in ""This Place is Death"". In late 2007, Locke awakens in a desert in Tunisia, where he is taken to a local hospital and visited by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale). Widmore tells Locke that he led the Others until Ben took over and tricked him into leaving the island. Widmore pledges to help Locke reunite the Oceanic Six—Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) son, Aaron—in order to take them back to the island. Widmore gives Locke a fake identity, Jeremy Bentham, and assigns Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick) to assist him. Sayid, Hurley and Kate all refuse to go back to the island after being visited by Locke. Locke also visits Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), but decides not to ask him to return to the island because he has been through enough already. Meanwhile, Kate's conversation with Locke leads him to look for his old girlfriend, Helen Norwood (Katey Sagal), who he discovers has died. While visiting her grave, Abaddon is shot and killed; Locke gets into a car accident after he flees the scene in a panic. He awakens in Jack's hospital, where the two once again argue about the island. Before Jack leaves, Locke tells him that his father, Christian Shephard (John Terry), is alive on the island. This greatly upsets Jack, and he leaves. Locke then goes to a hotel, where he attempts to hang himself. Ben, however, shows up and talks Locke down. He admits to shooting Abaddon, claiming it was to protect Locke. After learning of Locke's plan to seek advice from Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan) on how to return to the island, Ben kills Locke, making it look like suicide. He then takes Jin-Soo Kwon's (Daniel Dae Kim) wedding ring, which Jin had entrusted to Locke. The narrative returns to the present on the island, where Locke discovers an unconscious Ben among the injured passengers of Flight 316. This episode and ""316"" were written at the same time by executive producers Lindelof and Cuse. ""The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham"" was originally meant to be aired first, but the order was switched because they felt it made more sense and was ""cooler.""[1] While in the ""mini-camp"" where the writing team decided the plot elements of season five, it was decided to have five episodes continuing the story of most characters, before a ""concept episode"" telling the story of Locke's journey before dying, as it was ""the missing piece"" to the story of the Oceanic Six and their return to the island.[5] The script originally requested for Locke to suffer a head-on collision, but stunt coordinator Michael Trisler suggested a change to a crossroads accident between three cars, because a head-on could not be reenacted in a way it would be safe to the stunt driver. Two blue cars like the one Locke drives were used for the stunts.[6] The episode attracted 12.078 million American viewers[7] and 359,000 Australian viewers.[8]",4732,8.8
LaFleur,5,8,Mark Goldman,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Kyle Pennington,Sawyer,2009-03-04,10.61,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaFleur_(Lost),"""LaFleur"" is the eighth television episode of the fifth season of ABC's Lost.[2] The 94th episode of the show overall, ""LaFleur"" aired on March 4, 2009, on ABC in the United States, being simulcast on A in Canada.[3] The episode was written by co-executive producers Elizabeth Sarnoff and Kyle Pennington and directed by editor Mark Goldman.[2] Having lost Charlotte Lewis in the time flashes, James ""Sawyer"" Ford, Juliet Burke, Miles Straume, Jin-Soo Kwon and Daniel Faraday realize the time flashes have stopped, and they find themselves in 1974. Sawyer then perpetuates a lie to the DHARMA Initiative to protect themselves from mistakes of the past. Following the events of ""This Place is Death"", a time jump briefly takes the remaining group of survivors — James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), Miles Straume (Ken Leung), Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) — to a time when there is an ancient statue standing on the island (the remnants of which are seen in ""Live Together, Die Alone""). They are only able to see the back of it before John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) turns the wheel, bringing the survivors forward to 1974, at the peak of the Dharma Initiative's presence on the island. Now that John has pushed the wheel, the time jumps have stopped and they are stuck in the past. The group comes across a pair of Dharma Initiative members who have been captured by two of the island's native inhabitants, known as the Others. Juliet and Sawyer kill the Others and free Amy (Reiko Aylesworth), but her husband Paul (Casey Byrnes) has been killed. The group returns to the barracks, where Amy resides. However, she tricks them into walking through the sonic fence which surrounds the barracks, knocking them unconscious. Sawyer wakes up and is confronted by Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison), the leader of the Dharma Initiative on the island. Sawyer tells him that his name is James LaFleur and that he and the other survivors were part of a shipwreck on the island, and that they are still looking for other members of their crew. Horace tells him that they will have to leave the next day on the submarine because they are not ""Dharma material"". Meanwhile, Daniel sees Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) as a young girl, but decides not to say anything to her. That night, the spokesman of the Others, Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), enters the barracks to determine why his treaty with Dharma was broken. Sawyer convinces Alpert not to attack Dharma, because he is the one who killed the Others. Alpert is further convinced when Sawyer shares knowledge of the events that transpired in 1954 in the episode ""Jughead"". Because Sawyer has successfully defused the situation, Horace allows the group to stay for two weeks and look for the other crew members of their ship, when in reality they are waiting for Locke to return with the survivors who left the island. Three years later, the survivors have joined Dharma and are living in the barracks. Sawyer is the well respected head of security, while Jin (who is now fluent in English) continues to search for those who left the island. Amy is pregnant with Horace's baby and due to give birth in two weeks. Following an argument between them, Horace gets drunk and hurls sticks of dynamite at trees and Amy goes into early labor; Juliet successfully delivers the baby, the first that survived in all her time on the island. Horace believes that Amy is not yet over her deceased husband, however Sawyer reassures him by stating that three years is enough time to get over someone, referring to his relationship with Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly). Sawyer returns to his home, where he lives with Juliet, with whom he is now in a relationship. The next morning, he receives a call from Jin, who has found Kate, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) in the jungle (as seen in ""316""). Sawyer secretly meets them far from the barracks, where they are reunited. In the episode ""Confirmed Dead"", Charlotte's birthday is said to be July 2, 1979. This led to a minor continuity error in ""LaFleur"", when Charlotte is depicted as being a young girl in 1974. Executive producers Cuse and Lindelof claimed in a podcast that the original script for ""Confirmed Dead"" listed Charlotte's birthday as being in 1970 and that Mader had it changed because she did not want people to think she was significantly older than she actually is. This caused a controversy when Mader later stated on her blog that Gregg Nations, the script coordinator, was the one who suggested the change. Cuse and Lindelof later conceded that she was right.[4][5] The episode gained 12.396 million American viewers[6] and 339,000 Australian viewers.[7] ""LaFleur"" garnered generally positive reviews from critics. Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a positive review, stating ""The narrative successfully establishes a new direction for the story from here on out and gives us an exciting, yet familiar, setting for the next few episodes."" He also liked the episode's focus on Sawyer, saying ""This is a great James Ford episode. It's been a while since we've had an opportunity to see Sawyer's con artist skills put to the test and he definitely delivers this week.""[8]",4923,8.9
Namaste,5,9,Jack Bender,Paul Zbyszewski & Brian K. Vaughan,none,2009-03-18,9.08,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste_(Lost),"""Namaste"" is the ninth television episode of the fifth season of ABC's Lost.[2] The 95th episode of the show overall, ""Namaste"" aired on March 18, 2009, on ABC in the United States, being simulcast on A in Canada.[3] The episode was written by supervising producer Paul Zbyszewski and producer Brian K. Vaughan and directed by executive producer Jack Bender.[2] In 1977, when Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) return to the past unannounced, James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) further perpetuates his lie to continue to hide their true identities. All that suddenly changes when Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) is found as well, but is forcefully captured by Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) in order to hide the lie. In 2007, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson), Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) and the passengers of the Ajira Airways Flight 316 arrive on the island in the present. The episode begins with the crash of Ajira Airways Flight 316, a transpacific flight piloted by Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), on the small island off the coast of the main island, where the Dharma Initiative Hydra Station is located. Lapidus crash lands the plane on a runway that was built by the native population of the island, known as the Others, and the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 (as seen in ""The Glass Ballerina""). While the passengers begin to debate what to do next, crash survivor and former leader of the Others Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) begins to travel to the main island. He is followed by survivor Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), who believes her husband Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) is on the main island, and later Frank. After reaching a group of canoes, Sun knocks Ben out with an oar (Ben reappearing still unconscious in the Hydra station, as seen in ""The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham"") and travels with Frank to the abandoned barracks of the Dharma Initiative. Waiting there is Christian Shephard (John Terry), who shows Sun and Frank a picture of new recruits to the Dharma Initiative from 1977, including Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia). He also tells her that Jin is with them in 1977. In 1977, following the events of the previous episode ""LaFleur"", James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) explains to Jack, Kate and Hurley the situation regarding Dharma and the shift in time. Sawyer arranges for the three of them to join the Dharma Initiative as new recruits (Jack is assigned janitorial work and Hurley is a chef and Kate works in the motor pool) with help from Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), who forges the necessary documentation. Juliet also learns that Amy (Reiko Aylesworth) has named her baby Ethan, who will eventually join the Others.[4] Meanwhile, Jin travels to the Dharma Initiative Flame Station because he believes that its occupant, Radzinsky (Eric Lange), will know if Flight 316 crashed on the island. There is no evidence of a plane crashing on the island as the plane is in 2007. Soon, an alarm is set off and Jin finds Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) wandering in the jungle. After a brief moment of reunion, Jin is forced to act as if Sayid were a Hostile to placate Radzinsky, who would not understand where Sayid really came from. Sawyer is summoned to the Flame and moves Sayid to a jail cell at the Barracks while he decides what to do. Later in the evening, Jack visits Sawyer and Juliet's house to discuss the situation. James tells Jack that he is in charge and has a different approach to leadership than Jack had with the survivors of Oceanic 815: Sawyer prefers to carefully plan out his actions, as opposed to Jack's more impulsive style of command. Meanwhile, at the jail, an adolescent brings Sayid a sandwich and introduces himself as Ben (Sterling Beaumon). The episode was written by supervising producer Paul Zbyszewski and producer Brian K. Vaughan and directed by executive producer Jack Bender.[2]Eric Lange made his first out of seven scheduled guest appearances on the show in this episode as Stuart Radzinsky. Radzinsky had originally been mentioned once in the season 2 finale, making ""Namaste"" his first full appearance. Lange said that a couple days after his audition, he got a call telling him that he had gotten the role of Radzinsky. In November 2008, he traveled to the set in Hawaii. Lange had been a fan of the show since it started and had always wanted to be a part of it. He said: ""To be able to work on something in a capacity like this, it's a dream job. It's one of the most exciting things I've done.""[5] In Australia, the episode brought in 389,000 viewers, ranking 35th for the night.[6]",4086,8.5

The episode was written by executive producers Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz and directed by ""Special"" director Greg Yaitanes.[2] In 1977, Sayid Jarrah's (Naveen Andrews) presence among the DHARMA Initiative makes them anxious; he is interrogated, and admits everything he knows. In flashbacks, Sayid struggles after his purpose off the island is cut short. As a child, Sayid watches as his older brother is forced by his father to kill a chicken as a rite of passage. He is unable to do it, so Sayid does it for him; this greatly pleases Sayid's father. While working for Ben (Michael Emerson), Sayid kills a man in Moscow. This is the last man on Ben's hit list, leaving Sayid uncertain about how to continue living his life. After John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) dies, Ben visits Sayid and encourages him to go to California, telling him of Locke's death and Hurley being watched. Following the events of ""This Place is Death"", Sayid meets Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) at a bar; she skillfully seduces him and then takes him into her custody at gunpoint. She turns out to be a bounty hunter who has been employed to take Sayid to Guam by the family of Peter Avellino (Armando Pucci), who Sayid previously killed for Ben, on the golf course, (as seen in ""The Economist""). After seeing some of the Oceanic Six preparing to board the same flight, he begs her to take the next plane, but she refuses. On the plane, after he sees Ben board, he asks Ilana if she is working for Ben. Sayid describes Ben as a monster and Ilana asks Sayid why should she would work for a man like Ben. Sayid replies, ""I did."" Following the events of the previous episode, ""Namaste"", Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) is in the Dharma Initiative's jail. He is questioned by Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison), Dharma's leader; Radzinsky (Eric Lange), Dharma's head of research; and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), who, under the alias of LaFleur, is Dharma's head of security. Sayid does not say anything and is later visited by a twelve-year-old Ben Linus (Sterling Beaumon). Ben's father (Jon Gries) witnesses this and assaults Ben for bringing Sayid food. Sayid is later confronted one-on-one by Sawyer, who in an effort to save Sayid, tries to convince Sayid to give a false confession of being a defector from the island's native population, the Others. Sayid refuses and is subsequently taken to Oldham (William Sanderson), Dharma's resident interrogation expert (""He's our you,"" as Sawyer describes him to Sayid). Oldham gives Sayid a truth serum which forces Sayid to reveal his knowledge of Dharma's stations, including the future Swan Station, and that he has previously been to the island. However, he also tells them that he is from the future, which discredits his story. Upon returning to the jail, Sayid is once again visited by Ben, who pledges to free Sayid because Ben wishes to join the Others. That evening, several members of the Dharma Initiative take a vote to decide whether to execute Sayid. After an impassioned statement from new mother Amy (Reiko Aylesworth), they all vote in favor of execution. Sawyer attempts to let Sayid escape, but Sayid refuses, stating he has found his purpose for returning to the island. Meanwhile, at the barracks, Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) expresses her concern to Sawyer that their relationship will be jeopardized because of Kate Austen's (Evangeline Lilly) return to the island. Kate learns of their relationship from Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia). Later in the evening, Sawyer goes to Kate's house and asks her why she came back to the island. Before she can answer, however, a flaming Dharma van crashes into one of the houses. While everyone is distracted by the fire, Ben helps Sayid escape from the jail. They run into Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) during their escape, so Sayid knocks Jin out and steals his gun. After saying to Ben ""You were right, I am a killer,"" Sayid reluctantly shoots Ben in the chest and runs off.",4051,8.5

In flashbacks, Kate takes care of Sawyer's (Josh Holloway) favor and begins to tell the truth to protect Aaron (William Blanchette). Kate develops a friendship with Sawyer's ex-girlfriend Cassidy (Kim Dickens) and Sawyer's daughter Clementine (Olivia Vickery). Kate tells Cassidy the truth about everything that happened on the island, including that baby Aaron (William Blanchett) is not her son. Cassidy eventually leads Kate to realize that the reason she took Aaron as her own, is because Kate needed him in order to get over her emotional attachment to Sawyer. After this realization, she decides to return to the island with the others who left. She leaves Aaron in the care of Carole Littleton (Susan Duerden), Aaron's biological grandmother. Kate also tells Carole that she is returning to the island to find Carole's daughter, Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and bring her home. Following the events of the previous episode, ""He's Our You"", Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) wakes up and notices that Ben Linus (Sterling Beaumon) has been shot by Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews). He brings Ben to the barracks so that his injuries can be treated by Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell). Juliet is unable to perform the necessary surgery on Ben and sends James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) to retrieve Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), a spinal surgeon. Meanwhile, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Miles Straume (Ken Leung) debate the nature of time travel, a particular point being why older Ben after meeting Sayid again in 2004 (as seen in ""One of Them""), did not seem to remember being shot as a boy, by Sayid. Jack, knowing what Ben does in the future, refuses to help. This drives Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) to do everything she can to help Ben. Kate goes to the sick bay where Ben is being treated and donates her blood because she is a universal donor. She strikes up a conversation with Ben's father, Roger (Jon Gries), who is upset that Ben stole his keys and freed Sayid from the jail. Once it becomes clear that Ben will succumb to his injuries without further intervention, Kate decides to take Ben to the Others, the island's native population. Sawyer comes to Kate's aid and they bring Ben to Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who warns them that if he treats Ben, he will not remember what has happened and will never be the same again. They agree anyway. Richard carries Ben into the temple seen in ""This Place is Death"". Another Other urges Richard to inform ""Ellie"" of his intentions and implies that ""Charles"" will not be pleased if he finds out, but Richard says he doesn't answer to either of them. Ben (Michael Emerson) awakens from being knocked unconscious in ""Namaste"" and is greeted by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn).",4061,8.3

In flashbacks, the origins of the strained relationship of Ben and Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) are revealed. In 1977, Ben wakes up in the Others' camp, not remembering that he was shot. He meets the leader of the Others, Charles Widmore, who tells him he's one of them. In 1988, Ben kidnaps Alex as a baby from her mother Danielle Rousseau (Melissa Farman), whose life he spares. Before leaving, Ben tells Rousseau to run the other direction if she hears whispers. He returns to the Others' camp with the baby, which disappoints Charles, who wanted Ben to kill both mother and daughter. Some time later, Charles is banished from the island for breaking the rules by leaving the island frequently and fathering a daughter with an outsider. Before he leaves the island by submarine, Charles tells Ben that Ben will ultimately be banished as well, because he was unable to sacrifice Alex's life. Following Alex's death and his leaving the island, Ben confronts Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger), Charles's daughter, and shoots her husband Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick). Ben states his intention to kill Penny in retribution for his own daughter's death, but hesitates upon seeing Penny's son, Charlie. Ben's hesitation allows Desmond to recover and severely beat him. Following the final scene of the previous episode, ""Whatever Happened, Happened"", Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) wakes up after having been knocked unconscious by Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) in the episode ""Namaste"". He is greeted by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), whom Ben previously murdered. Ben tells Locke that he (Ben) has broken ""the rules"" by returning to the island after he left it in the episode ""There's No Place Like Home"", and that he must be judged by the smoke monster. Locke agrees to accompany him to the main island. Before leaving, Ben retrieves a picture of his adopted daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde) from his old office at the Dharma Initiative Hydra Station. Ben also tricks one of the other survivors from Ajira Flight 316, Caesar (Saïd Taghmaoui), and steals his shotgun. When Ben and Locke try to leave the smaller island on a canoe, they are halted by Caesar, whom Ben suddenly shoots in the chest. Upon arriving on the main island, Ben and Locke travel to the Dharma Initiative's barracks, where they find Sun and Flight 316 pilot Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey). Sun shows him the photograph of Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), who have traveled back in time to 1977 and joined the Dharma Initiative. Sun also tells Ben that Christian Shephard (John Terry) instructed her to wait for Locke because together they will be able to rescue the others from the past. Frank decides to return to the smaller island where he is taken hostage by Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) and several of the other 316 survivors, who ask him if he knows ""what lies in the shadow of the statue."" Meanwhile, Ben, Locke and Sun travel to a temple belonging to the island's native population, called the Others. Underneath the temple, Ben is separated from Locke and confronted by the smoke monster, which replays several of Ben's memories of Alex. The smoke dissipates and a manifestation of Alex appears to Ben, telling him that she knows of his intention to kill Locke again. She warns him to follow Locke's lead without question if he wishes to live. Ben agrees and his life is spared.",4326,8.8

The episode was written by co-producer Melinda Hsu Taylor and ""Eggtown"" writer Greggory Nations and directed by Jack Bender.[2] The title is a reference to the film, Some Like it Hot and the fictional planet Hoth in the Star Wars universe.[citation needed] In 1977, Miles Straume (Ken Leung) and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) deliver a package to a top DHARMA official. Meanwhile, a security breach is being suspected after young Ben has disappeared. In flashbacks, Miles is recruited by Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) to go to the island. As a child, Miles discovers that he can hear the voices of dead people, so long as their bodies are nearby. When his mother, Lara (Leslie Ishii), is dying of cancer several years later, Miles questions her about his father. She tells him that his father died when Miles was still a baby and that he never cared about her or Miles. Miles has been employed by a man (Dean Norris) to speak with his dead son. Since the boy's body was cremated, Miles lies to the man and says that the boy knew his father loved him. Some time later, Miles is approached by Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) who, after ascertaining that Miles is not a fraud, offers him $1.6 million to go to the island on the freighter. He agrees, however he is later kidnapped by a group of people who claim that the owner of the freighter, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), is on the ""wrong team."" Miles says he will not go to the island if they can provide him double the money ($3.2 million, the amount Miles asks for in ""Eggtown""). Their leader, Bram (Brad William Henke), who is later a passenger on Ajira Airways Flight 316, asks Miles the question, ""What lies in the shadow of the statue?"" Miles cannot answer, so he tells Miles that he won't be ready to go to the island until he can. They then let Miles go. Miles later returns the man's money, saying that he lied and that the man should have told his son that he loved him before he died. Following the events of ""Whatever Happened, Happened"", Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) return from bringing Ben Linus (Sterling Beaumon) to the island's native population, known as the Others. Kate returns to the infirmary where Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) had been treating Ben for a gunshot wound. Ben's father, Roger (Jon Gries), arrives and notices that Ben has gone missing. Sometime later, Kate approaches Roger, who has been drinking, and tells him that everything will be okay. He grows suspicious of her and demands to know what happened to Ben. He later tells Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) of his suspicions, leading Jack to tell Sawyer and Juliet. After dismissing Jack, Sawyer is confronted by Phil (Patrick Fischler), who has seen the security video of Sawyer taking Ben. Sawyer knocks Phil unconscious and tells Juliet to get some rope to tie him up. Miles Straume (Ken Leung), meanwhile, is sent by Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison), the Dharma Initiative's leader on the island, to the construction site of the Swan Station to retrieve a dead body and bring it to Dr. Pierre Chang (François Chau), Miles's father, at the Orchid Station. Before he can bring the body to Dr. Chang, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes tries to take the van containing the body, in order to deliver food to the Orchid Station. Since they are both going to the same place and there are no other vans available, Miles reluctantly agrees to let Hurley accompany him. On the way, Hurley finds the body and realizes that Miles is able to communicate with dead people, an ability Hurley also possesses. After discussing the differences between their abilities, they arrive at the Orchid Station, where Miles transfers the body to Dr. Chang, who, after disposing of the body, requires a ride to the construction site. After dropping him off, Miles discovers that Hurley is writing the screenplay for the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back, from memory, in order to give it to George Lucas. Hurley compares Miles's relationship with his father to the relationship between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, as well to the relationship between Hurley and his father. Hurley says that the best thing he ever did was forgive his father for abandoning him and suggests Miles do the same. Miles goes to Dr. Chang's house and briefly observes him interacting with his three-month-old self. However, Dr. Chang is on his way out and takes the older Miles to the dock, where a submarine is arriving with Dharma scientists, among whom is Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies). Faraday recognizes Miles and mentions that it has been a while since they have seen each other.",3796,8.3
The Variable,5,14,Paul Edwards,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Faraday,2009-04-29,9.04,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Variable,"""The Variable"" is the 14th television episode of the fifth season of Lost, and the 100th episode overall.[2] It originally aired on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on April 29, 2009. The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by cast and crew on location in Hawaii. In the episode, Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) returns to the island in order to warn its inhabitants of a catastrophe involving the Dharma Initiative research station, The Swan. Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and Daniel begin a gun fight with Dharma, leading Dharma to go after Sawyer (Josh Holloway) and Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell). In flashbacks, Daniel's relationship with his parents, Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan) and Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), is shown. The episode was written by executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by Paul Edwards. It serves as a companion piece to the season four episode ""The Constant"", another episode that heavily features the character Daniel, and the third Lost episode to deal directly with the concept of time travel. Since airing, the episode has received generally positive reviews from television critics, mostly complimenting Davies's performance. At a young age, Eloise asks Daniel if he knows what destiny is and then tells him that he has a special gift — his brilliant mind — and that his destiny relies on this. After Daniel graduates from Oxford University, Eloise gives him a new journal as a gift and again reminds him of his destiny. Meanwhile, Daniel has received an enormous research grant from Charles, who Daniel does not know is actually his father. Years later, following the crash of Flight 815, Daniel has suffered severe psychological effects from performing experiments on himself; he has lost his mental acuity, and now lives with a caretaker. While watching the news coverage of the discovery of the Flight 815 wreckage in the Sunda Trench, Daniel is visited by Charles, who tells him that he faked the found wreckage and that the real plane actually landed on the island. Charles invites Daniel to go to the island, which Charles claims will cure his psychological problems. Eloise later visits Daniel and further encourages him to go to the island. Following the events of the previous episode, ""Some Like It Hoth"", Daniel has returned to the island, having spent three years in Ann Arbor, Michigan, conducting research for the Dharma Initiative. He has returned because Jack, Kate and Hurley (Jorge Garcia) have managed to travel back in time and become part of the Initiative. After learning from Jack that they were sent to the island by Daniel's mother, Eloise (younger: Alice Evans; older: Fionnula Flanagan), Daniel visits Dr. Pierre Chang (François Chau) at the Orchid station and warns him of a catastrophic event that is to occur at the Swan station in six hours. Dr. Chang does not believe Daniel when he says that he is from the future, and Miles (Ken Leung) does not affirm Dan's story, even after Daniel informs Dr. Chang that Miles is his son from the future. At the Barracks, Sawyer, Juliet, Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), Hurley and Miles decide that they will flee to the survivors' original beach, abandoning Dharma. But Kate, Jack and Daniel decide to visit the island's native population, the ""Others"", and get help to prevent the impending disaster. They arouse suspicion from Dharma's head of research, Radzinsky (Eric Lange), while trying to steal weapons and a gun fight ensues. The survivors are able to escape; however, Radzinsky brings his team to Sawyer and Juliet's house, where they find Dharma member Phil (Patrick Fischler) tied up. Meanwhile, Daniel explains to Jack and Kate that he intends to detonate the hydrogen bomb that had been buried on the island in 1954 in order to prevent the construction of the Swan, which in turn will ensure that Oceanic Flight 815 never crashes on the island, which means it never becomes visible to Widmore's team, so he never sends the freighter which brings himself and Charlotte, therefore Charlotte doesn't die. Daniel enters the Others' camp with his gun drawn and demands that Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) take him to see Eloise; Eloise shoots Daniel in the back as they argue, to Richard's disapproval. As he dies, Daniel tells Eloise that he is her son, and comments that she (referring to her older self) knew he was going to die on the island and sent him anyway.[3] Following the events of ""Dead is Dead"", Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) is brought to a hospital, having been shot by Ben (Michael Emerson). While waiting, his wife Penny (Sonya Walger), is visited by Eloise, who apologizes for involving Desmond in everything that has happened. Penny later visits Desmond, who is expected to make a full recovery. Charles, who is also Daniel's father, speaks with Eloise outside the hospital, but does not visit his daughter. ""The Variable"" was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by Paul Edwards. Like most season five episodes, it features elements of time travel. It serves as a companion piece to the season four episode ""The Constant"", another episode that heavily features the character Daniel, and the third Lost episode to deal directly with the concept of time travel after ""Flashes Before Your Eyes"" from the third season and ""The Constant"" from the fourth season. In ""The Constant"", Desmond and Sayid (Naveen Andrews) are on their way off the island when their helicopter hits turbulence, causing Desmond's 1996 consciousness to take over his 2004 body and switch uncontrollably between 1996 and 2004. Lost show runner Damon Lindelof said the fifth season of the show has ""flung major characters across decades, leaving them — and the audience — feverishly attempting to keep events straight and the end game in sight.""[4] In ""The Variable"", the viewers would get a few more pieces of the puzzle, Lindelof said, and added: ""We're not promising any big whiz-bang flash pyrotechnics, but it does serve as a companion piece to another memorable episode, last season's 'The Constant', in which Desmond endured vicious, turbulence-caused side effects from traveling in time.""[4] Lindelof also commented that the fifth season is about the rules of time travel as explained by Daniel, and said, ""We've never done a flashback story for Daniel, so he's very mysterious. Some of those mysteries will be answered in this episode.""[4] Since Lindelof and his show runner partner Carlton Cuse wrote ""The Constant"", they thought the ""sister episode"" should be written by someone other than them, which led to Kitsis and Horowitz writing it. The two show runners were pleased with the outcome of the episode. Cuse thought it was one of the best episodes of the season.[5] The episode features the death of Jeremy Davies' character Daniel Faraday. Daniel was introduced in the fourth season and was originally intended to be a minor character only. However, his quiet demeanor and seemingly good heart made him a favorite with the fans, so Lindelof and Cuse decided to expand Daniel's role, which has led to him being a key player in Lost's eventual resolution.[6] In response to Daniel's death, Cuse said, ""It was an incredibly painful thing to kill this beloved character, but we feel that’s what this show has to do. His death is kind of the culminating event in the entire season. It really ends one chapter and commences the start of the final chapter of the entire series.""[7] Once the show runners explained that to Davies, he was saddened that his full-time status on Lost was coming to an end, but put the story ""above his own personal self"".[7] Damon seconded Carlton's emotions, adding that Jeremy took the news well: ""When Carlton and I called Jeremy to explain what was going to be happening with Daniel, we’ve never had a more awesome exit interview with somebody on the show. For us, Daniel really was the cornerstone of the fifth season – he really shined. I can’t imagine what Season 5 would have looked like without Jeremy Davies. When you think about all the crazy stuff that had to come out of that guy’s mouth, for him to be as interesting and emotional and poetic as he was is really extraordinary.""[7] The cast of the show said Davies would be missed, though he may not be done with Lost — Carlton commented that Jeremy's ""full-time"" status was over, but dead characters have been known to reappear on the show. Michael Emerson, who plays Ben, said Davies was ""a great sensitive guy who got deep into his character, he really lived it.""[7] ""The Variable"" was the hundredth episode of the show to be produced and aired on television. Josh Holloway, who plays the role of Sawyer, said, ""Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me.""[8] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, ""We're probably not going to get past episode thirteen. Let's all be honest about that up front."" Lindelof added that if he had ""traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting that we were going to make it to a hundred and still have a season beyond that, I would have laughed in my face.""[4] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode (""LOST in Hawaii"") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.[9] ""The Variable"" was watched live or recorded and watched within five hours of broadcast by 8.8 million viewers in the United States, achieving a 3.9/10 in the coveted adults aged eighteen to forty-nine demographic. Lost was that Wednesday's number one scripted television show in the aforementioned demographic for its thirteenth straight original telecast.[10] In Australia, the episode was watched by 296,000 people, ranking forty-sixth for the night.[11] Since airing, the episode has received generally positive reviews from television critics, mostly complimenting Davies's performance as Daniel. Chris Carabott of IGN commented that if this is the last appearance of Davies on Lost, which he ""somehow"" doubts, then, ""I'm glad he had the opportunity to leave on such a strong note. He delivers in some really great, emotional, moments this week – especially in the scenes in which he is suffering from memory deterioration. I've become a huge fan of Davies over the course of the last couple of years thanks to his performance on this show.""[12] Rachel Dovey of Paste said the episode revealed ""a whole different"" side of Daniel: ""We've oscillated before about the true nature of the physicist, whether it's good or evil [...] We decided he's mostly a decent guy, barring the whole experimenting-on-his-girlfriend-then-running-away-when-her-brain-turned-to-mush thing. In the past, he's just seemed lost and confused, and, since he has those big, earnest puppy eyes, we decided to forgive him. But 'The Variable' showed us the dynamic at the heart of Daniel's stuttering vulnerability. Like all broken superheroes and Freudian beings, the man has mommy issues. This week we dove inside the dynamic between Daniel and his mother growing up.""[13] Adam Sweeney of Film School Rejects was positive about the episode, ""For anyone who has been complaining that Lost had been too slow lately, here you go. Those who watched 'The Variable' saw more action than (basketball player) Wilt Chamberlain. They, and by they I mean we, also got a clear explanation of how the islanders got onto the island. You wanted answers, you got them.""[14] Sweeney also believed Davies's acting was the ""high point"" of the episode.[14] David Oliver of CHUD.com gave the episode an 8.6 rating out of 10, and commented that it was a ""good"" episode, though he was ""bummed"" to see Daniel go. Oliver also said that while the episode did ""very little"" to advance the season storyline significantly, there were ""some significant"" developments and revelations in it.[15] TV Verdict's Stephen Lackey said the episode was ""fast paced"" and featured ""one exciting twist after another"".[16] The episode also received some criticism. Dan Compora of Airlock Alpha said after a run of ""several strong"" episodes, Lost ""has slipped into mediocrity. While none of the recent episodes have been bad, they haven't been anything special. For a hundredth episode, average simply isn't good enough. While the shooting of Daniel at the end was stunning, I expected something much more from the rest of the episode than learning the identity of Daniel's parents.""[17] A reviewer for TVoholic.com thought the episode was good, though not as good as ""The Constant"", and he thought ""it came with lots of answers and references to past episodes from this season and the ones before it, making it all the more exciting.""[18] The reviewer would, however, have ""loved any sort of explanation as to why [Daniel] changed his mind about changing the past or how he thought this could work. There must have been something that made Daniel think this was possible, but he was in such a rush that he never took care to explain.""[18] Jon Lachonis of TVOvermind said that as an internal character piece, ""The Variable"" was not ""so much a great ending for Daniel. We brushed up against many key events and people – Theresa, Daniel’s ‘nurse’, and the Widmore and Eloise parental connection, etc. – but these forays into the geniuses’ past events were more to thread Daniel through the plot than to establish their connection to who Daniel truly was.""[19]",4502,8.8
Follow the Leader,5,15,Stephen Williams,Paul Zbyszewski & Elizabeth Sarnoff,none,2009-05-06,8.7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follow_the_Leader_(Lost),"""Follow the Leader"" is the 15th television episode of the fifth season of ABC's Lost.[2] The 101st episode of the show overall, ""Follow the Leader"" aired on May 6, 2009, on ABC in the United States. The episode was written by supervising producer Paul Zbyszewski and co-executive producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and directed by Stephen Williams.[2] This episode marks the lowest recorded audience for Lost. In 2007, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) solidifies his leadership with the Others, but Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) and Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) start to be suspicious of Locke. In 1977, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) dispute over whether to initiate the plan of the recently deceased Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies). James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) are interrogated by the DHARMA Initiative. Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), Miles Straume (Ken Leung) and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) finally reveal the truth to Pierre Chang (François Chau). In 1977, following the events of the previous episode ""The Variable"", Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) witness a young Eloise Hawking (Alice Evans) kill her adult son Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) in the Others' camp. As Jack and Kate debate whether they should follow through with Faraday's plan to detonate a hydrogen bomb in order to change future events, they are attacked and captured by the younger version of Charles Widmore (David S. Lee). Eloise believes their claim of being from the future and decides to take Jack's advice to detonate the bomb. They travel with Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) to a pond, which has an underwater entry to a series of tunnels in which the bomb is stored. The tunnels lie beneath the site of the Dharma Initiative's barracks. Kate does not want to take part in Jack's plan and leaves. However, an Other refuses to let her go, prompting an unseen Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) to shoot the Other. Sayid agrees to Jack's plan, but Kate still refuses and compares Jack to John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), whom Jack once regarded as crazy. She leaves for the barracks and the others enter the tunnels. At the Dharma Initiative barracks, James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) are being held captive by Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison), Stuart Radzinsky (Eric Lange) and Phil (Patrick Fischler). Sawyer does not answer any of Radzinsky's questions, even after he is severely beaten and witnesses Phil strike Juliet. Meanwhile, Dr. Pierre Chang (François Chau) confronts Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), Miles Straume (Ken Leung), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) as they ready their escape to the beach. He wants to know if Faraday was correct concerning time travel. Chang asks Hurley time-specific questions which he fails to answer correctly; Hurley then concedes they are indeed from the future. Miles confirms that he is Chang's son, and supports Faraday's request for the island to be evacuated. Chang informs Horace and Radzinsky of this, and Sawyer makes a deal to leave the island on the submarine in exchange for telling them what they want to hear. Sawyer and Juliet, followed by Kate, are placed aboard the submarine in handcuffs. The sub departs. In 2007, following the events of the episode ""Dead is Dead,"" Locke meets with Richard at the Others' camp and tells him that he now has a purpose. Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) confronts Richard about the fate of her husband and the other survivors stranded in the past. Richard grimly informs her that he watched them all die. Locke, Richard, and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) travel to the location where the time-jumping Locke will appear, so that Richard can remove the bullet from his leg and tell him what needs to be done (as seen in ""Because You Left""). They return to camp, where Locke speaks to the Others and tells them that they are going on a trip to see Jacob, from whom they take orders but have never met. Locke tells Sun that Jacob will know how to save their friends. However, he later admits to Ben that his plan is not to ask Jacob for help, but to kill him. This episode gained 8.70 million American viewers,[3] the lowest number in Lost's history. In Australia, it brought in 266,000 viewers, ranking forty-ninth for the night.[4]",4139,8.7
The Incident,5,16,Jack Bender,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,Jacob,2009-05-13,9.43,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incident_(Lost),"""The Incident"" is the season finale of the fifth season of ABC's Lost, consisting of its 16th and 17th episodes.[2] Both parts of ""The Incident"", the show's 102nd and 103rd episodes overall, aired on May 13, 2009, on ABC in the United States. The episode was written by executive producers/showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by Jack Bender.[2] Jack Shephard's (Matthew Fox) plan to change the future is met with resistance from others, while John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) assigns Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) a difficult task. This episode features the first appearance of the mysterious leader of the Others, Jacob, after being mentioned several times throughout the series. Jacob is portrayed by Mark Pellegrino, and appears in the flashbacks of various Oceanic Flight 815 survivors and mysterious Ajira Flight 316 survivor Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson). The episode was watched by 9.428 million viewers,[3] and was well received by critics and audiences. It was also nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series in 2009. The episode opens with Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) weaving a tapestry inside a temple-like room. He is then shown on the beach of the island eating a fish near the large four-toed statue of Taweret,[4] where he is visited by a man in a black shirt (Titus Welliver). The man comments on a sailing ship on the horizon, suggesting that Jacob has brought it to the island. The man states that no matter who comes to the island the same thing happens over and over, and that the man will eventually find a ""loophole"" so he can kill Jacob. In flashbacks, various characters encounter Jacob. As a little girl, Kate is visited by Jacob when she is caught shoplifting a lunchbox. He pays for it to placate the shopkeeper and tells her to be good. At age eight, Sawyer is visited shortly after his parents' funeral. He has begun writing his letter to the con man ""Tom Sawyer"", but his pen is out of ink. Jacob gives him a replacement. Sayid is visited at the same time that his wife Nadia (Andrea Gabriel) is killed; Jacob asks Sayid for directions and as they start crossing the street Nadia is hit by a car. While recovering in a Russian hospital, Ilana is visited by Jacob and he asks for her help. Immediately after being pushed out of an eighth-story window by his father, Locke apparently dies. Jacob arrives and touches him on the shoulder, and Locke reawakens. Sun and Jin are visited by Jacob at their wedding and he tells them that their love is special in fluent Korean. After performing his first solo surgery on a young girl (a story he recounts to Kate in ""Pilot, Part 1""), Jack tries to buy a chocolate bar from a vending machine, but it gets stuck. Jack argues with his father (John Terry) for interrupting him during the surgery. Jacob buys the same chocolate bar and when two come out, he gives Jack one. Hurley is visited after he is released from prison, between the events of ""The Little Prince"" and ""316"". Jacob tells him that he may not be cursed or crazy, but blessed, and that his ability to see dead people could be a gift. He tells Hurley about Flight 316, giving him the choice of boarding it. Jacob leaves a guitar case behind for Hurley to take. One thing all these flashbacks have in common is that Jacob makes physical contact with each of the characters in his or her respective scene, except Ilana. In a flashback not featuring Jacob, Juliet's parents tell her that they are getting divorced, greatly upsetting her; they claim that though they love each other, they were not meant to be together. Following the events of the previous episode, ""Follow the Leader"", Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) are on a submarine leaving the island. Kate convinces Juliet and Sawyer that they need to stop Jack from detonating a hydrogen bomb on the island. They force the captain (William Makozak) to surface so that they may leave, instructing the captain to continue on course away from the island. They arrive on the island, where they are greeted by Vincent the dog, who has been in the care of Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell) and Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) for the past three years. Rose explains to the trio that she and Bernard are now retired and live a quiet life near the beach, scavenging food and avoiding detection by the Dharma Initiative. Rose points them to the Dharma barracks and they leave. At the same time, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) dismantle the hydrogen bomb in the tunnels under the Dharma Initiative's barracks, in order to remove its core. Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) and a younger Eloise Hawking (Alice Evans) assist Jack and Sayid in entering the barracks via the basement of one of the houses. Richard knocks out Eloise to prevent her traveling with them to detonate the bomb because she is pregnant. Sayid dons a Dharma jumpsuit in order to fit in at the barracks; they almost escape when Roger Linus (Jon Gries) recognizes him and shoots him. Jack and Sayid escape in a van driven by Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), along with Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and Miles Straume (Ken Leung). Hurley drives to the construction site of the Swan station, while Jack treats Sayid's wounds; however, they are stopped by Juliet, Sawyer and Kate. Jack and Sawyer discuss the situation away from the other survivors, with Sawyer expressing his opinion that ""what's done is done"" and that they shouldn't try to change the past. Jack claims that it is his destiny to change the past and that John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) has always been right about the island. Jack and Sawyer get into a fist fight, which is broken up by Juliet, who now agrees with Jack that they must detonate the bomb. ""I changed my mind."" She tells Sawyer that although they love each other, they are not meant to be together (echoing her parents), and that if they never meet then she will never have to lose him. Meanwhile, Dr. Pierre Chang (François Chau) is forced to continue drilling into the energy source beneath the construction site of the Swan station on the orders of Stuart Radzinsky (Eric Lange). With everyone now in agreement, Jack enters the construction site at the same time that security officer Phil (Patrick Fischler) arrives with a team of armed men. A massive gunfight ensues, wherein the survivors gain the upper hand, allowing Jack to drop the bomb into the pit at the same time that the drill hits the energy source. The nuke fails to go off, and the pocket is breached, attracting every metal object in the area. In the ensuing chaos, Dr. Chang's arm is crushed by part of the drill mounting, Phil is stabbed by a rebar, and Juliet is dragged into the chasm by a metal chain. Sawyer attempts to pull her up in vain, and Juliet professes her love for him before falling. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Juliet survived the fall. She finds the undetonated nuke and begins hitting it with a rock, until it finally goes off. The screen then cuts to white as the episode ends. Locke, Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and the Others travel to the remains of the Taweret statue, where Jacob resides. Locke assigns Ben the task of killing Jacob, and provides motivation by reminding Ben of all the bad things that have happened to him. Ben admits that he has never seen Jacob and was lying about talking to him, because he was embarrassed he had never met Jacob. All communication with Jacob was through notes brought by Richard, including the lists of people to be taken from the Oceanic 815 survivors. At the same time, a group of survivors from Ajira Flight 316, including Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) and Bram (Brad William Henke) travel towards Jacob's cabin, with Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) and a giant metal crate from the cargo of the plane. They find the cabin deserted. They set it on fire after realizing that someone else has been using it. They then travel to the statue. Their group arrives shortly after Ben and Locke enter a chamber in the base of the statue's remains. Ilana asks Richard the question, ""what lies in the shadow of the statue"", and Richard replies, ""Ille qui nos omnes servabit"" (Latin for ""He who will save us all.""[5]). Ilana reveals the contents of the crate: John Locke's dead body. Inside the chamber, Jacob immediately recognizes Locke as the Man in Black from the opening flashback, who has been masquerading as the resurrected Locke since the crash of Flight 316. Ben stabs Jacob repeatedly. Jacob's final words are a warning to the man: ""They're coming."" The Man in Black then kicks Jacob's body into the fire and watches it burn. Throughout the previous seasons, the final scene of each season had a secret code name. This was to prevent spoilers from leaking out. Another factor to prevent the leak of spoilers was that only the writers, director, and actors involved with the scene were allowed access to the script. During a May podcast, executive producers/writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse invited fans to choose the code name for the finale of season five. After numerous suggestions, the two decided upon their favorite thirteen. These thirteen were then allowed to be voted on by fans as the name. The resulting name was ""The Fork in the Outlet"". This episode breaks the tradition of ending with the ""LOST"" title screen, with the words in white and a black background. Instead, ""LOST"" is in black, and the background is white. The Swan construction site was built in the same place the Hatch was shown in seasons 1 and 2, in He'eia. Due to being in a state park area, the producers had to get permits and work with geologists to excavate and build the set, as well as restoring the location to how it was before. The base of the statue where Jacob lives was a live-action set, but the stone foot was built with computer-generated imagery.[6] The finale has been well received by audiences and critics alike. In a review for IGN, Chris Carabot praised the finale, calling it ""heart-wrenching"", and praised the performances, especially Michael Emerson and newcomer Mark Pellegrino, calling him ""yet another example of some of the brilliant casting choices we've seen on this show."" He went on to give the episode an overall score of 9.8, saying that he was ""excited to see how this cliffhanger plays out in the final chapter of the series.""[7] Alan Sepinwall of the Star-Ledger reviewed the episode positively, but complained about the episode being ""another explosive chapter"" of the love triangle. Sepinwall also called it ""so exciting, so mythology-intensive, so loaded with great performances and great character notes, so all-around kick-ass, that I feel more than satisfied.""[8] Jeff Jensen of PopWatch said that the opening scene with Jacob and his nemesis was enough to make the episode legendary.[9] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post felt that the season finale was more of the first act of the show's final act, and thought that many of the themes were left unresolved.[10] Variety's Cynthia Littleton was pleased when Rose and Bernard returned in the episode, having been absent for most of the season.[11] She speculated that they are the Adam and Eve skeletons found by the survivors early in season one,[11] which Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly also suspected.[12] (This was not correct). James Poniewozik of Time also liked their appearance in ""The Incident"".[13] Chris Carabott of IGN ""love[d]"" this scene as the characters were no longer watching the island mysteries, but had become part of them.[14] He said ""Their outlook is refreshing"" and hoped they would feature more often in season six.[14] Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger called it ""one of the best, most moving scenes of the finale"".[15] Noel Murray from The A.V. Club thought the scene was useful in both practical and thematic senses, as it allowed the characters to leave the show, but also it caused him to question whether opting out was ""the voice of reason, or the voice of evil"".[16]The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter incorrectly thought their decision not to participate ""all but solidified them as the 'Adam and Eve' from the caves"".[17] ""Words [could not] describe"" how pleased Maureen Ryan from the Chicago Tribune was with Rose and Bernard's scene, and she agreed with Rose's sentiment ""It's always something with you people"".[18] At the 2011 Young Artist Awards, Savannah Lathem received a nomination for Best Performance in a TV Series under the category ""Guest Starring Young Actress"".[19]",5942,9.2
LA X,6,1,Jack Bender,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,various,2010-02-02,12.09,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LA_X,"""LA X"" comprises the 104th and 105th episodes of the American Broadcasting Company's Lost, marking the premiere of the sixth and final season.[2] It was written by show runners/executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by executive producer Jack Bender.[3] Both parts were aired on February 2, 2010, on ABC in the United States and CTV in Canada, and on February 4, 2010, on RTÉ Two in Ireland.[4][5] The story deals with the aftermath of the detonation of the hydrogen bomb at the end of the previous episode, ""The Incident"". ""LA X"" introduces a new narrative device, two separate timelines, that replaces previously used devices, such as flashbacks, flash-forwards and time travel. Cuse and Lindelof have stated that the ""two distinct timelines"" are ""equally real"".[6] Both ABC and the producers refer to these scenes as ""flash sideways"".[7] The date of first broadcast was the source of much speculation, as ABC intentionally avoided locking down a timeslot to keep options open in order to assess the threat of the upcoming Olympic Games and to better fit Lost with how other shows were performing on ABC's schedule. Scheduling was further placed in jeopardy when it was announced that the chosen night was being considered for the 2010 State of the Union Address. The season premiere was the first episode of Lost to air on a Tuesday in the United States. Despite the fact that there is no specific character on which the premiere is centered, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes, Jack Shephard, Kate Austen, John Locke, Sun-Hwa Kwon, Sayid Jarrah, Jin-Soo Kwon and James ""Sawyer"" Ford each have points of view in the premiere. After Jughead's detonation, two scenarios are shown: one in which Oceanic 815 never crashes, and one in which the timeline hasn't been altered at all. The first timeline begins on Oceanic Flight 815, in which the survivors' attempt to change the future has apparently successfully averted the crash. The island is now shown to be at the bottom of the ocean. Most of the characters' situations remain the same, e.g. Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is still being transported in custody of U.S. Marshal Edward Mars (Fredric Lehne); Dr. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) is transporting his deceased father; and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is still paralyzed. However, there are some differences as well, e.g. Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) is returning to Los Angeles without his stepsister; Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) claims to be the luckiest man alive; Locke claims to have participated in his walkabout; Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) is a passenger and Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell) reassures Jack while experiencing turbulence. During the flight, Jack is called upon to save Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), who has asphyxiated while attempting to swallow a small packet of heroin. Jack, with the help of Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), resuscitates him. Jack had earlier encountered Desmond; however, he is nowhere to be seen when the plane lands. Charlie is arrested for drug possession after the plane has landed. After the plane lands safely at LAX, Jack is informed that the airline has lost his father's coffin. Kate escapes custody of the marshal. Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) is detained after he fails to declare a large amount of cash on his customs form. His travel partner, Sun-Hwa Paik (Yunjin Kim), who claims she can't speak English, does nothing to help the situation. Kate hijacks a taxicab in which Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) is also a passenger. Jack speaks with Locke, who notes that his own luggage has also been misplaced. They discuss Locke's condition, which Locke tells him is irreversible. Jack responds that nothing is irreversible, reveals that he is a spinal surgeon, and offers Locke a free medical consultation. In the second timeline the events directly follow those of ""The Incident"". Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sayid, Jin, Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), and Miles Straume (Ken Leung) have been returned to the present at the site of the Dharma Initiative Swan station, immediately after Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) has killed Jacob (Mark Pellegrino). Sawyer is angered by the prospect that Juliet's death was meaningless and engages in a fight with Jack. However, Juliet is alive underneath the remains of the station. The survivors eventually free Juliet, but she dies soon after, moments before she can tell Sawyer something important; Sawyer blames Jack. Hurley tends to Sayid, who has been mortally wounded by a gunshot. Jacob appears to Hurley and explains that he (Jacob) has been killed and that Hurley must take Sayid to the Others' temple in order to heal him. Hurley must also bring the guitar case that Jacob previously gave him. The survivors split up, with the majority going to the temple, while Sawyer and Miles stay behind to bury Juliet. Sawyer forces Miles to use his medium skills to talk to Juliet. Miles relays her message: ""It worked"", which leaves Sawyer confused. At the temple, the group encounters the remaining members of the Others who have taken refuge, including Flight 815 stewardess Cindy (Kimberley Joseph) and the two abducted children, Zack and Emma, who have been missing since they were taken in by the Others. The survivors are captured and brought before two men, Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada), a Japanese man, and his translator, Lennon (John Hawkes).[8] Hurley tells them that Jacob sent him, and offers the guitar case as proof. Inside is a wooden ankh, which Dogen breaks open, revealing a note that tells the Others they will all be in trouble if Sayid dies. Sayid is brought to a spring, noted to have gone murky, where he is held underwater until the time of an hourglass passes. Jack administers CPR, but Sayid does not respond. They believe Sayid has died. Sawyer and Miles are brought into the temple, having been captured after burying Juliet. Dogen questions Hurley in a separate room, where Hurley reveals Jacob is dead. Shocked by this news, the Others sound an alarm, prepare their defenses, and send fireworks into the air in preparation for an attack. Lennon insists on speaking with Jack privately. Jack refuses, leading to an altercation, when suddenly Sayid comes back to life. Inside the pedestal of the statue, the Man in Black, who has taken the form of Locke, orders Ben to bring Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) inside. Once Ben delivers this news, Richard refuses and shows Locke's body to Ben. Bram (Brad William Henke) and his team from Flight 316 enter the statue with Ben. The Man in Black transforms into the smoke monster and easily kills Bram and his men, but spares Ben. After returning to Locke's body, the Man in Black then tells Ben what Locke's final thoughts were as Ben strangled him to death; which is that Locke didn't understand why Ben killed him. He then reveals that John Locke was the only one among the initial survivors who wanted to stay and live on the island. The Man in Black then reveals that his own true goal is to return home. Outside, Richard sees the fireworks from the temple. The Man in Black then confronts Richard, who realizes who the man is, but the Man in Black quickly knocks him out and announces that he is disappointed in the Others as he carries Richard into the jungle. Dominic Monaghan appears as Charlie after a 30-episode absence. Ian Somerhalder also reprises his role as Boone for the first time since the episode ""Exposé"", while Kimberley Joseph appears as flight attendant Cindy Chandler for the first time since the episode ""The Brig"", both from the third season. Greg Grunberg recorded lines in Los Angeles for a voice-over reprisal of his role of Oceanic Airlines Captain Seth Norris of Flight 815 that crashed on the island in the pilot episode.[9] Originally, Maggie Grace was set to make an appearance as Shannon, but Grace was unable to film any scenes due to her busy schedule. Thus, the backstory was rewritten to accommodate this.[10] In terms of genre elements, Damon Lindelof has stated that, ""We sort of suckered people into this show [by] not presenting it as a science fiction show right out of the gate … Lost has really been about the long con, because by the time we get to season 6, it's going to be...crazy!""[11] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, ""the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. We've known what we were going to do for a couple years now and there's been a tremendous amount of work setting up the premise so it would work.""[12] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, ""We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year"", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season ""were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too.""[13] Cuse has also stated, ""We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [The new] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning.""[12] Cuse further explained that the new narrative ""doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series"",[14] keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that ""you really don't have to have seen the show [to watch the season]. There will be stuff that will go completely over your head for sure, but because of the way that they're telling this last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion.""[15] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. Lindelof finally conceded that ""by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will have pretty much all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [will] end.""[16] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with ""Trust us.""[17] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, ""We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. The problem with alternative realities is that you never know when the rug is going to be pulled out from under you. We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! But we're ANTI-paradox. Paradox creates issues.""[18] Actor Terry O'Quinn has divulged that ""it is revealed who Locke actually is. Although that's still kind of a mystery of who is that. But there's still a pretty big revelation there.""[19] As the third season was wrapping production in May 2007, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse negotiated with ABC for the show to end in three years.[20] The remaining three seasons were to each be a third shorter, containing just sixteen episodes each that would air consecutively week after week from early February through mid-May.[21] The fourth season premiered on the last day of January in 2008, but was soon interrupted and truncated by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, adding an episode apiece onto the remaining seasons. Then-co-executive producer Edward Kitsis speculated that these would translate into more two-part episodes.[22] The fifth season premiered two weeks early to allow for two breaks in the season for a rerun and a clip-show respectively. In June 2009, the producers ordered an additional hour for the show's final season.[23] Cuse explained that ""For us, [eighteen hours] is just about right. I mean, we aren't sitting here feeling like, 'Oh my God, we need a ton more hours to tell the rest of our story.' It feels like it's going to work out just fine. It will have been the right length.""[24] In September, ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson advertised that the final season would be the first Lost season to run uninterrupted and entirely repeat-free;[25] however, Cuse said in October that Lost would premiere in January in order to take a two-week break in February to avoid competing with NBC's coverage of the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games.[26] Having been shuffled around the primetime schedule five times (airing Wednesday at 8:00 in the first season, Wednesdays at 9:00 for the second and fifth seasons and part of the third season,[27] Wednesdays at 10:00 for part of the third season and on Thursdays at both 9:00 and 10:00 for different parts of the fourth season)[28] and remaining a top twenty program in Nielsen ratings, McPherson had defined Lost as a ""wildcard asset"",[29] elaborating that ""it's a great position to be in. We're going to see where we are coming into the spring and see what happens. It's a tool to use.""[30] With ABC's new Wednesday sitcom block performing well,[31] ABC ultimately ruled in November that Lost would move to Tuesdays at 9:00/8 central for the first time, premiering in February and running straight through with original episode broadcasts into mid-May, not taking a break for the Olympic Games.[32] On January 6, 2010, it was reported that the White House was considering two dates for Barack Obama's annual State of the Union address, which is typically on the last Tuesday of January at 9:00:[33] January 26 and February 2.[34] Were the latter date selected, the Lost premiere would be preempted and have to air at a later date, sabotaging months of promotion by ABC for ""The Final Season"" and forcing some awkward rescheduling of the season, which had no leeway for interruptions.[35] This prompted an online protest among fans and the story was picked up by dozens of media outlets.[36] On January 8, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs announced ""I don't foresee a scenario in which millions of people who hope to finally get some conclusion with Lost are preempted by the president"",[37] to which Damon Lindelof responded via his Twitter account with ""OBAMA BACKED DOWN!!!! Groundhog Day is OURS!!!!!!! (God Bless America)"".[38] Ben East of the United Arab Emirates The National newspaper summed up the story with ""confirmation of just how important [Lost] is came with an almost unbelievable communiqué from the White House last week … That's right. Obama might have had vital information to impart upon the American people about health care, the war in Afghanistan, the financial crisis—things that, you know, might affect real lives. But the most important thing was that his address didn't clash with a series in which a polar bear appears on a tropical island. After extensive lobbying by the ABC network, the White House surrendered.""[39] Lindelof later recounted, ""What's amazing is you realize how fickle your political affiliations are. I'm a lifelong Democrat, but when I first heard that they were considering February 2, I was like, 'That motherfucker!' """"[40] The episode received critical acclaim from critics. Critical review aggregate website Metacritic assigned ""LA X"" a score of 89/100, indicating ""universal acclaim"" and making it the best-reviewed season premiere of the 2009-2010 television season.[41] Chris Carbot of IGN gave the episode a strong positive review, stating that ""season six is off to a fantastic start"", although he criticized the first hour of the premiere for its pacing and lack of ""information that needs to be imparted to the audience."" Overall he gave the episode a score of 9.2.[42] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club also praised ""LA X"", stating that he ""loved pretty much every minute"", and grading it A.[43]Variety's Cynthia Littleton praised the premiere as well, calling it ""worth the ten-month wait.""[44] Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune gave the episode a perfect score, stating ""This was a fantastic season premiere. I was on the edge of my seat as all the revelations and heartbreaks and the dual timelines unfolded"".[45] Alan Sepinwall of the Star-Ledger reviewed the episode positively as well, calling it ""fun"" and comparing it to the pilot episode.[46] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode four out of five stars, explaining that ""the skilful hands who craft that show assembled everything so intricately that we were treated to a thoroughly compelling adventure … On this evidence, Lost will go out on a high"". He particularly enjoyed the ""breathtaking camera swoop"" from Oceanic 815 to the submerged island, saying that it ""showcased [a] cinematic, visceral texture"". Rawson-Jones commended Terry O'Quinn's dual-role performance, but lamented the treatment of Juliet's death, assessing it as melodramatic and predictable and calling it ""the only real sore point of the generally brilliant season premiere.""[47] The episode was watched by 12.1 million American viewers,[48] 1.70 million Canadian viewers,[49] 1.406 million viewers in the United Kingdom,[50]",5026,8.7
What Kate Does,6,3,Paul Edwards,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Kate,2010-02-09,11.05,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Kate_Does,"""What Kate Does"" is the 106th television episode of the American Broadcasting Company's Lost and third episode of the sixth season. It was written by executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed in September 2009 by Paul Edwards.[2] ""What Kate Does"" was first aired February 9, 2010, on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada.[3]Kate Austen is the character on whom the episode is centered. In December 2007, Kate Austen chases after James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), who escapes from the Others' captivity in the island's temple and is grieving over the death of his love Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) just hours earlier. In flash sideways to September 22, 2004, Kate assists a pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) while on the run as a fugitive. The title alludes to the second season episode ""What Kate Did"". ""What Kate Does"" was watched by eleven million Americans and received mixed reviews by audiences and critics alike. In flash sideways, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) flees LAX in a taxicab she has hijacked, in which a pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) is a passenger. The cab driver (David H. Lawrence XVII) bails and Kate lets Claire go, keeping all of Claire's possession in her haste. She drives to a chop shop, where a mechanic (Jeff Kober) frees her from handcuffs. While searching for a new outfit, Kate learns that Claire is pregnant. She returns to where she left Claire, returns her luggage and offers her a ride. She drives Claire to the house of Lindsey Baskum (Jenni Blong), the woman who was supposed to adopt her baby, but Lindsey's husband has left her and, devastated, she no longer wants the child. Claire goes into labor on the doorstep and Kate takes her to the hospital, where Claire's doctor is Ethan Goodspeed (William Mapother). The police later come looking for Kate in the hospital, but Claire covers for her, allowing Kate to escape. Following the events of the previous episode, ""LA X"", Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) has come back to life after apparently dying. The Others, led by Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada) and his translator Lennon (John Hawkes), wish to speak with Sayid, privately. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), however, wishes to go with them and starts a fight. James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) seizes the opportunity to obtain a gun and announce his departure from the temple, explicitly telling Kate not to follow him. The Others send Kate, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and two of their own, including Aldo (Rob McElhenney), to bring Sawyer back. Meanwhile, Dogen brings Sayid to a room, where ash is blown on him, followed by being given an electric shock and then burned with a poker. Dogen later explains to Jack that he has diagnosed Sayid as being infected and gives Jack a pill for Sayid to take. Jack refuses and takes the pill himself, which Dogen hurriedly forces him to regurgitate, revealing that the pill is in fact poison. He explains that the infection, upon reaching Sayid's heart, will remove any trace of the person he once was, and adds that it has happened to Jack's half-sister, Claire. In the jungle, Kate, Jin and the Others come across a trap; Kate activates the trap and overcomes the Others. Jin and Kate split up; Kate follows Sawyer's trail, while Jin begins to search for his wife, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim). Kate finds Sawyer at the Dharma Initiative's barracks, in the house where he and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) had previously lived for three years. He retrieves an engagement ring he had hidden and later talks with Kate at Dharma's dock. He explains that he planned to propose to Juliet and that he blames himself for her death, saying that he convinced her to stay on the island with him because he was lonely. Meanwhile, Jin is caught by the Others, who want to kill him instead of taking him back. Jin runs off but is caught in a beartrap. Suddenly, someone shoots his captors and Jin is shocked to see that the shooter is Claire. The episode has received mixed reviews. Critical review aggregate website Metacritic awarded ""What Kate Does"" a score of 64 out of 100,[4] indicating ""generally favorable reviews""; however, this was down significantly from the previous episode's 89[5] and Bonnie Covel of About.com noted that ""'What Kate Does' brought us a bit of negativity. In general, fans just didn't like the episode"".[6] ""What Kate Does"" was largely considered to be a step down from the season premiere in pacing, revelations and writing; Mike Hale of The New York Times described the episode as ""contemplative"", ""anticlimactic"" and ""subdued"" and the flash sideways as ""kind of boring and seemingly pointless.""[7] Chris Carabott of IGN, who gave the episode a score of 7.3 summed up that "" 'What Kate Does' slows the pace down significantly from last week and focuses on telling a character-driven story. This is a welcome change; especially after the heavily plot-driven season five. However, with questions to answer and so much ground to cover during this final season, a better balance between plot and character wouldn't have been such a bad thing.""[8] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote, ""Maybe I'll enjoy the 2004 scenes more when we get to some other characters … but this week it was largely a distraction from all that was happening on the island. And even the island scenes were only sometimes satisfying.""[9] Further explanations for the generally less positive reception came from Entertainment Weekly's Jeff Jensen with ""Lost has a habit of following up its premiere extravaganzas with scaled-down follow-ups that seek to ground the audience and orient them to a more deliberate pace to the season""[10] and Emily VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times explained, ""Kate episodes … have notoriously tricky relationships with [fans]. Kate's one of the show's most important characters, for sure, but she's also one of the series' most obvious missed opportunities … Lost isn't very good, period, at creating female characters … the show doesn't quite know how to write a woman of action who's also in love … many of the show's Kate flashbacks are just plain silly … there have been a lot of pretty dire Kate episodes.""[11] Whitney Matheson of USA Today said that she ""wanted to stab Kate with a hot poker"" after watching ""What Kate Does"".[12] Josh Holloway's supporting performance as a grieving Sawyer was commended by Carabott of IGN, who said that his acting on the dock as he cried and revealed to Kate that he was going to ask Juliet to marry him was ""one of Josh Holloway's best scenes of the entire series.""[8] Holloway's acting was called ""wrenching"" by Jensen of Entertainment Weekly,[10] ""[t]errific"" by Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune,[13] ""stellar"" by Chuck Barney of the San Jose Mercury News,[14] ""moving (sometimes)"" by Rob Cohen of The Huffington Post,[15] ""so palpable"" by Noel Murray of The A.V. Club (""Grade: B"")[16] and ""believable and moving"" by VanDerWerff of the LA Times, who further said clarified that ""There's no better actor for man tears in this cast"".[11] Sean Stangland of the Daily Herald speculated that Holloway might be worthy of a Primetime Emmy Award by the end of the season.[17] Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger felt that Holloway's presence excelled the lead performance as Kate by Evangeline Lilly, whom he identified as ""one of the less compelling members of the cast"", opining that ""Being in Josh Holloway's orbit tends to bring out a spark in Lilly that isn't always there opposite other characters and the scene at the dock was a strong example of that.""[9] VanDerWerff of the LA Times agreed that Lilly was believable in the scene and commented that Lilly has improved as an actress since the show started, but has been relegated to playing a character in a tired love triangle for much of the show's history.[11] James Poniewozik of Time was more positive toward her, writing that ""Lilly is playing her exactly right, as someone who's always had to balance a desire to do the right thing with circumstances that have forced her to look out for her self-interest.""[18] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly admired Lilly's subtlety and said, ""you believe this woman, who can be so adorable that she can withstand Sawyer’s nickname of “Freckles,” is entirely capable of killing someone.""[19] Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger also commented, ""I quite like the gravity and mystery of Hiroyuki Sanada's performance as Dogen, and I was even more intrigued by how un-Sayid-like Naveen Andrews seemed, seeming so timid and confused and in pain … as Sayid the torturer was himself tortured"";[9] Poniwozik of Time also appreciated Andrews's work.[18] Jack's character development was another highlight for critics, including Carabott of IGN,[8] Murray of The A.V. Club,[16] and Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad.[20] Jensen of Entertainment Weekly explained, ""The New and Improved With 70% More Likability Jack that brought some dazzle back to Kate's eyes was clearly a man who had learned some lessons about how the Others do business.""[21] Jensen commended how Jack ""confessed the limits of his knowledge and power"" and his actions in all subsequent scenes from the episode.[21] Poniewozik of Time was annoyed by the Others refusing to answer questions, but stated that ""here I'm willing to forgive that for setting up the genius scene of Jack surprise-popping the poison pill.""[18] In contrast, Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times said, ""Another thing I find supremely annoying about Lost: its insistence on returning again and again to the show's most uninteresting characters, including damaged, self-pitying control freak Jack.""[22] Deggans was negative toward ""What Kate Does"", stating that ""Episodes like this one can make real Lost fans feel like dopes. Already, you're taking heaps of abuse from friends who accuse you of slavishly following a series which makes no sense—then along comes a 60-minute workout like this one which proves their point all too well.""[22] Daniel of TMZ, who gave the episode a ""D"" grade, reacted uniquely with ""The only thing in the history of Lost that has seemed more out of place than the part in Jack's hair was Nikki and Paulo. I can't take anything he says seriously.""[23] Ryan McGee of Zap2it stated that it by no means compared to ""LA X"", but stated that it ""contain[ed] scenes of incredible beauty, based on character work and stakes earned over five seasons [that] made it a fine, if imperfect, hour.""[24] McGee also commented that the scene in which Claire arrives at the hospital and is helped by Ethan as ""freakin' outstanding"" and called ""What Kate Does"" ""one of the funniest in the show's history. Aldo, Hurley, and Miles all got off plenty of zingers, which will be necessary in a season in which both mythological and dramatic stakes are raising higher and higher each week.""[24] VanDerWerff of the LA Times,[11] Ryan of the Chicago Tribune,[13] Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger,[9] Jensen of Entertainment Weekly[10] and Mark Medley of the National Post also found the episode to contain humorous lines.[25] This episode was watched by 11 million American viewers and 1.57 million Canadian viewers.",4288,7.7
The Substitute,6,4,Tucker Gates,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Melinda Hsu Taylor,Locke,2010-02-16,9.82,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Substitute_(Lost),"""The Substitute"" is the fourth television episode of the American Broadcasting Company's sixth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 107th episode overall. The episode aired on February 16, 2010, on ABC. It was directed by Tucker Gates and written by executive producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and producer Melinda Hsu Taylor.[2]John Locke is the character the episode is centered on. In 2007, The Man in Black, while impersonating John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), attempts to recruit James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and reveals the survivors' purpose on the Island. Meanwhile, Jacob's (Mark Pellegrino) bodyguards, led by Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson), decide to bury the corpse of the real John Locke. In the ""flash-sideways"", Locke, still wheelchair-bound, deals with the difficulties of his life. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) arrives at his home, after returning from Australia on Flight 815. He is greeted by his fiancée, Helen Norwood (Katey Sagal), whom he is set to marry shortly, in a wedding also apparently to be attended by his father. Helen encourages Locke to call Dr. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), who previously offered to evaluate Locke's condition. Locke declines to do so because he doesn't believe in miracles and wants Helen to love him for who he is; they reaffirm their love for one another. Locke returns to work, where his supervisor, Randy (Billy Ray Gallion), confronts Locke about Locke's failure to attend a company conference while in Sydney. Locke attempts to apologize, but Randy abruptly fires him. As he leaves the building, Locke comes into contact with Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), the owner of the company, who refers Locke to a temp agency that he also owns. At the temp agency, Rose Nadler (L. Scott Caldwell) sympathizes with Locke's handicap because of her own battle with cancer. Rose denies his request to work at a construction company because his handicap will make this impossible. In addition, Locke tells Helen why he lost his job and admits that he went to Australia to go on a walkabout, but was not allowed to do so. Rose eventually finds him work as a substitute teacher at a school where Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) also works as a history teacher. The Man in Black, in the form of Locke, attempts to recruit both Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) and James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) for his quest to leave the island. Sawyer immediately realizes that the Man in Black is not Locke, because Locke was always scared and the Man in Black is not. He separately promises each of them answers about the island; Richard refuses and Sawyer agrees to travel with him. While in the jungle, they both see a young boy (the Man in Black is surprised that Sawyer can see him as well), whom the Man in Black chases. The boy tells him, ""You know the rules; you can't kill him."" At this, the Man in Black becomes angry and loudly declares ""don't tell me what I can't do,"" a phrase that the real Locke frequently used in the past. At this time, Richard speaks with Sawyer, claiming that the Man in Black's true intention is to kill everyone on the island, but runs away before he can explain further when sees ""Locke"" returning. Locke leads Sawyer to a cave, after descending via a ladder made of rope and bamboo, inside of which is a set of scales holding one black and one white stone. Locke takes the white stone and throws it into the sea, referring to it as an inside joke. Locke leads Sawyer deeper into the cave, where there are several surnames written on the ceiling and walls. The names include his own, Jarrah, Shephard, Reyes, and Kwon (referring to either Sun or Jin). Several other names are scratched out and the Man in Black crosses out ""Locke"". Additionally, six names correspond to one of the numbers (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42 for Locke, Reyes, Ford, Jarrah, Shephard and Kwon, respectively). He explains that they were brought to the island by Jacob as candidates to replace him as the guardian of the island. The Man in Black claims that Jacob has manipulated the lives of all of the candidates in order to bring them to the island. Sawyer now has three options: to do nothing, to accept the job and protect the island, or to leave the island with the Man in Black, who claims that protecting the island is pointless as there's nothing to protect it from (similar to what Jack once told real Locke) ; Sawyer agrees to leave with him. Meanwhile, at the remains of the statue, Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) and Ben discuss what happened to her companions; Ben tells her that the Man in Black killed them all, including Jacob. Ilana, who is visibly upset, takes some of the ashes of Jacob's body and informs Ben that the Man in Black is now ""stuck"" in the form of Locke. Outside, she tells the remaining group, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) that they must travel to the temple for protection. Sun insists that they must first bury Locke's body and travel to the survivors' original graveyard to do so. They hold an impromptu funeral, where Ben delivers a short eulogy and apologizes for murdering Locke. The episode has received positive reviews, with many citing it as the best of the first four episodes. Review tally website Metacritic awarded the episode a score of 88 out of 100, indicating ""Universal Acclaim"". This is up on the previous episodes score of 64 out of 100.[3] Chris Carbot of IGN gave the episode a highly positive review, stating that ""Early on it's clear that Lindelof and Cuse are determined to reinvigorate some of the strong character work the show was known for during the first couple of seasons. There are some great examples of this in 'The Substitute'."" Overall, he gave the episode a score of 9.4 out of 10.[4] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode and gave a perfect score.[5] Emily VanDerWerff of Los Angeles Times also gave the episode a positive review, stating ""There may not have been enough answers for the hyper-mythological crowd (though we got a good deal of interesting conjecture), but it was a great showcase for the finest character ""Lost"" ever cooked up.""[6]Zap2it's Ryan McGee also praised the episode, calling the episode ""impossibly good.""[7] However, Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune was mixed about the episode, stating ""Even as a certified ""Lost"" fan, I was a little frustrated with the episode at times. I think the cumulative effect of not truly understanding many characters’ motivations is starting to wear on me a bit.""[8]",3972,8.3
Lighthouse,6,5,Jack Bender,Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof,Jack,2010-02-23,9.950000000000001,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_(Lost),"""Lighthouse"" is the fifth television episode of the American Broadcasting Company's sixth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 108th episode overall. The episode aired on February 23, 2010, on ABC in the United States and 2 hours earlier on A in Canada due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.[2] The episode was written by showrunners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and was directed by Jack Bender.[2]Jack Shephard is the character centered on this episode. In 2007, the ghost of Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) instructs Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) to bring Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to an unspecified place. Meanwhile, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) finds Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) after 3 years of disappearance, but begins to question her sanity. In the ""flash-sideways"", Jack deals with the issues of parenthood. Following the events of the season premiere, ""LA X"", Jack Shephard arrives late to pick up his son, David (Dylan Minnette), from school. David is shown to be distant from his father. Jack visits his mother (Veronica Hamel) to help find Jack's father's will, leaving David alone. Jack and his mother discuss David; his mother reveals that David was quite upset at his grandfather's funeral, but he never showed it to Jack. She suggests that perhaps David is ""terrified"" of Jack, just as Jack was afraid of his father as a child, and recommends Jack ask David about this. Finally, they find the will, but are confused to see Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) included in it, whom they never heard about; unbeknownst to them, Claire is Jack's half-sister. Jack returns home to find that David has snuck out. Jack goes to David's mother's house; his mother is absent but Jack learns that David is at an important piano recital. Jack goes to the conservatory where David is performing a stunning interpretation of Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu on the piano. Jack also runs into Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada), another parent at the event, who praises David's skill and believes he has a gift. Afterward, David admits that he didn't tell Jack about the recital for fear of disappointing him. Jack explains his complicated relationship with his father and reassures his son that he can never be a disappointment to him; David appears to warm up to his father now. Following the events of the episode ""What Kate Does"", at the Others' temple, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) is approached by the ghost of the deceased Jacob (Mark Pellegrino), who tasks Hurley on a mission to lead Jack to an unspecified location on the island in order to aid the arrival of someone en route to the island. Hurley has free rein to complete the mission because he is a candidate and even Dogen cannot stop him. Hurley uses the phrase ""you have what it takes"" to recruit Jack. Along the way, Jack and Hurley encounter Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), who tells them that she will neither return to the temple nor go with them, but continue her search for Claire. Jack and Hurley eventually pass through the caves, encountering the ""Adam & Eve"" skeletons and Jack's father's coffin. Hurley speculates that due to time travel, the skeletons could be someone they know in the present. Jack and Hurley arrive at a lighthouse, at the top of which is a large dial and a series of mirrors lined up. Each notch on the dial has a name listed next to it, corresponding to the surnames and numbers seen in ""The Substitute"". Hurley begins to move the dial to 108 degrees as instructed by Jacob, but Jack turns the dial to the 23 mark, where his own surname is listed, revealing Jack's childhood home in the reflection; Jack realizes that Jacob has been watching all of them for a long time, and becomes extremely upset. He angrily interrogates Hurley, who is unable to answer any of his questions since he cannot control when Jacob appears to him, leading Jack to destroy the mirrors. Outside, Jacob reappears to Hurley, congratulating him on bringing Jack to the lighthouse. Hurley realizes that Jacob did not want them to send a signal from the lighthouse, but instead needed Jack to see into the mirror and realize that he is important to the Island. Jacob also divulges that he needed to get Jack and Hurley away from the temple because ""someone bad"" was coming there. At the same time, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) is rescued by Claire from her trap, taking him and an injured Other, Justin, to her hideout. Claire reveals she's been living on the island in the 3 years since Jin and everyone else's departure. She treats Jin's leg injury and then threatens to kill Justin (whom she captures after he pretended to be dead) unless he tells her the location of her son Aaron. Justin helplessly says that he has no idea where Aaron is and the Others never kidnapped him. Claire believes that the Others have her baby because both her father and ""her friend"" told her so. Jin informs her that Kate has been raising Aaron off the island (as seen in Eggtown). Claire murders Justin, regardless, claiming he would do the same to her given the chance. Jin then claims that he was lying about Aaron earlier, leading Claire to say she would have killed Kate if it were true. Later, Claire's ""friend"", who turns out to be the Man in Black impersonating John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), shows up as Jin and Claire discuss how to return to the temple. Claire knows it's not Locke. The episode received positive reviews. Metacritic awarded a score of 71 out of 100. This was down on the previous week's episode, which scored an 88 out of 100.[3] Chris Carbot of IGN gave the episode a positive review, saying ""Lighthouse isn't filled with the wall-to-wall excitement of last week's Locke-centric story but it still has plenty of great moments and surprising revelations."" Overall, he gave the episode a score of 8.8.[4] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club praised the episode, and gave the episode a grade of A-.[5] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a positive review as well, stating ""tonight's episode, “Lighthouse,” was not as awesome as last week's episode, “The Substitute,” nor was it as mind-melting as the season premiere, “LA X.” But it was certainly better than “What Kate Does"" ... [and] the more I sit with this episode, the more I'm digging it.""[6] James Poniewozik of Time gave the episode a positive review as well, stating the episode ""moved the endgame forward.""[7]Variety's Cynthia Littleton praised ""Lighthouse"" for having ""a heavy old-school ""Lost"" vibe"" and the flash-forwards starting to make more sense.[8] However, some critics gave the episode mixed reviews. Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune thought, ""If I have any recurring complaint this season, it's this: A great episode of 'Lost' works as an hour of TV. It may leave you with questions but it doesn't leave you thinking you have to wait three or four or six more weeks to figure out certain basic facts about what's going on"".[9] Also, Eric Deggans of St. Petersburg Times gave the episode a negative review, criticizing Jack's storylines while praising Claire's, ""this is the new rhythm for Lost's final season; one groundbreaking episode filled with revelations and amazing characterizations, followed by an episode so static it feels as if the show is running in place … interesting moments came when it turned to the story of Claire in the post-crash timeline.""[10] IGN ranked the episode 41st out of the 115 Lost episodes, noting that ""the answers still weren't coming this early in Season 6, much to the confusion of fans everywhere"",[11] while the Los Angeles Times ranked ""Lighthouse"" as the 91st, saying it was ""a hotly divisive episode"" but ""improves the more the show fills in the gaps around it and the more the show makes Jack the center of its final season.""[12]",3925,8.1
Sundown,6,6,Bobby Roth,Paul Zbyszewski & Graham Roland,Sayid,2010-03-02,9.29,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown_(Lost),"""Sundown"" is the sixth television episode of the American Broadcasting Company's sixth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 109th episode overall. The episode aired on March 2, 2010, on ABC in the United States. The episode was written by co-executive producer Paul Zbyszewski and story editor Graham Roland (making his writing debut for the series) and directed by Bobby Roth.[2]Sayid Jarrah is the character the episode is centered on. In 2007, Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) delivers a message from The Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn). Due to this, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) is tasked by Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada) to kill the Man in Black, who gives Sayid a difficult decision. In the ""flash-sideways"", Sayid is drawn into a family crisis. Following the events of the season premiere, ""LA X"", Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) arrives at the home of his brother, Omer (Cas Anvar), and Omer's wife, Nadia (Andrea Gabriel). Late one night, Omer tells Sayid that he recently borrowed a substantial amount of money from a loan shark but had paid it back. Nevertheless, the loan shark has told Omer that he will owe interest forever. Omer asks Sayid to help with his problem. Sayid refuses because he no longer wishes to be a violent person. The next day, Omer is severely beaten and Nadia begs Sayid not to get involved. Nadia and Sayid discuss their feelings for each other, leading Sayid to tell Nadia that he doesn't deserve her. Later on, Sayid is taken to see the loan shark, Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand); after a short conversation, Sayid kills him and his men, including Keamy's henchman Omar (Anthony Azizi). While leaving the scene, he stumbles across Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), who is tied up in a freezer. Following the events of the previous episode, ""Lighthouse"", Sayid confronts Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada) about the poison pill. Dogen claims that Sayid is evil. They get into a struggle, but Dogen refuses to kill him, instead banishing Sayid from the temple. At the same time, the Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) sends Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) into the temple to ask Dogen to come out. He refuses to leave the temple and imprisons Claire. He then gives Sayid a dagger and instructs him to kill the Man in Black, in order to prove that he is still a good person. Sayid does as instructed, but the dagger has no effect. The Man in Black explains that Dogen never expected Sayid to succeed, only to get himself killed in the attempt. He then says that if Sayid cooperates, he can have anything he wants, including a dead loved one. Sayid is sent back to the temple with a message for the Others. Sayid delivers the Man in Black's ultimatum to the Others: any who do not leave the Temple before sundown will be killed. This causes a panic among the Others, most of whom, including Cindy (Kimberley Joseph), decide to leave. Amidst the chaos, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) returns to the temple in her search for Claire. She confronts Lennon (John Hawkes), who takes Kate to Claire. Kate explains that she has been raising Claire's son, Aaron, for the past three years but is unable to continue speaking with her. Meanwhile, Sayid confronts Dogen, who reveals how he came to the island: several years ago, he was a businessman in Japan who became drunk one night and caused a car accident that killed his 12-year-old son. Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) visited them in the hospital and offered to heal Dogen's son in exchange for Dogen coming to the island and never returning. After Dogen finishes his story, Sayid tackles him into the spring and drowns him. Afterward, he kills Lennon by slitting his throat. Dogen's death allows the Man in Black to enter the temple and attack the Others as the Smoke Monster. Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) arrive at the temple shortly after the attack begins, searching for the other candidates. While there, Sun finds out that Jin is alive. Ben goes looking for Sayid, but flees when he sees that Sayid has killed Dogen and Lennon. Kate is separated from the group and goes after Claire. Ilana, Sun, Frank and Miles Straume (Ken Leung) flee through a secret passage. After the attack, which leaves almost everyone dead, Sayid, Claire and Kate join the Others with the Man in Black outside the temple. This episode is the first to be co-written by Graham Roland. The episode received positive reviews. Metacritic awarded a score of 82 out of 100. This was up on the previous week's episode, which scored a 71 out of 100.[3] Cynthia Littleton of Variety described it as ""one of the creepiest and craziest episodes of 'Lost' ever.""[4]",3832,8.1
Dr. Linus,6,7,Mario Van Peebles,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz,Ben,2010-03-09,9.49,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Linus,"""Dr. Linus"" is the seventh episode of the sixth season of ABC's drama television series Lost. It is the 110th episode overall.[2] The episode was written by executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by actor Mario Van Peebles. The episode is centered on Benjamin Linus. In 2007, Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) is forced by Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson) to dig his own grave as a consequence of an uncovered lie. Meanwhile, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) attempts to convince Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) that they have a purpose. In the ""flash-sideways"", Ben copes with internal matters in his workplace. Dr. Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) is a history teacher at a high school. One day in the teachers' lounge, he has a particularly loud conversation with fellow teacher, Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), in which they complain about the lack of funding at the school, especially since Principal Reynolds (William Atherton) has made Ben watch over the kids in detention, instead of chaperoning the school's history club. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), a substitute teacher, suggests that Ben become principal instead. While tutoring his star pupil, Alex Rousseau (Tania Raymonde), Ben learns that the principal is having an affair with the school nurse. Ben enlists Arzt's help in hacking the nurse's email account and tries to blackmail the principal with this information and take his job. However, Reynolds says that he will write a negative letter of recommendation for Alex's college application if Ben makes good on his threats. Ben, unwilling to sacrifice Alex's future, backs down. He does, though, use his new leverage with the principal to get out of covering detention and restart the history club. Ben is also seen at home caring for his sick father (Jon Gries), who says he wishes he and Ben had never left the Island and the Dharma Initiative. Following the events of the previous episode, ""Sundown"", Ben, Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson), Miles Straume (Ken Leung), Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) flee from the temple, after the devastating attack by the Man in Black (also O'Quinn). Ilana discovers that Ben killed Jacob, after Miles examines Jacob's ashes using his ability to read the last thoughts of human remains. After the group travels back to the original survivors' beach camp, Ilana ties Ben up and forces him to dig his own grave, so that she can exact revenge as Jacob was, according to her, a father figure to her. The Man in Black arrives and attempts to recruit Ben, stating that he wants Ben to take over the Island once the Man in Black leaves with his followers. He frees Ben and tells him of a rifle standing against a tree about 200 yards in the jungle. As Ilana is trying to recapture him, Ben finds the rifle and gets the drop on her. But Ben only wishes to explain why he killed Jacob; he was afraid of losing his leadership position on the Island and felt rejected by Jacob, was angry because he chose the island over his daughter's life and was unable to forgive himself for letting her die. Ilana allows Ben to rejoin their group. Following the events of the episode ""Lighthouse"", Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) agree to return to the temple. Hurley attempts to stall Jack, as Jacob had warned him of the attack at the temple. But they come across Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who leads them to the grounded 18th century slave ship, Black Rock. Richard has become suicidal since Jacob's death because he believes that his life on the Island has been meaningless. He attempts to kill himself using dynamite. Jack even helps, knowing the Island won't let either of them die. When the dynamite fuse goes out, Jack convinces him that they are on the Island for a reason; they do have a purpose. They travel back to the beach and reunite with Ilana's group. Meanwhile, Miles has dug up some of the diamonds from Nikki and Paulo's grave. During the reunion, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) is shown to arrive near the island in a submarine. The episode received critical acclaim from critics. Review aggregate website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 92 out of 100, indicating ""Universal Acclaim"". The score was up on the previous week's score of 82, and is the best reviewed episode out of the first seven.[3] Steven Kurutz of The Wall Street Journal deemed it the best episode of the season, containing ""the perfect mix of action, drama and mysteries revealed."" Kurutz felt that Ben's storyline in the alternate universe was ""so much tighter"" than the other characters' presented in previous episodes, and that it was ""heartening"" rather than ""hokey"" to see Ben join the other characters on the beach at the end.[4] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger deemed ""Dr. Linus"" ""easily the most compelling episode of this final season so far,"" enjoying even the scenes involving Jack, despite his ""pathological hatred"" of the character.[5]Zap2it's Ryan McGee named the episode his second favorite of the season, kept only from superseding ""The Substitute"" by the overuse of Arzt.[6] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune called it ""a tautly constructed and thus very satisfying episode of TV"", deeming Emerson's performance ""awe-inspiring"" and the storylines ""heartbreaking"". She agreed with Kurutz's assessment of the alternate universe storylines, writing that ""Dr. Linus"" did ""the best job yet"" of linking the themes from both timelines together.[7] Emily VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the episode was the best since ""The Constant"", and also approved of the alternate timeline, feeling that it ""takes the basic components of Ben's fall from grace on the Island and uses them in a new fashion, reinventing not just the story of how he became who he was but also the story of who he is at his core.""[8] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club described the episode as having a ""strong finish"" but ""very shaky start"". He found the resolution of Ben's blackmail plot implausible and the subtext excessive, commenting: ""every scene and line in this episode seemed designed to make sure that we got the point about the cruelty of fate, the burden of power, and so on and so on."" Murray enjoyed the episode's ""poignant and tense"" final minutes, however, and rated the episode ""B-"" overall, later rethinking his grade and changing it to a ""B"".[9]BuddyTV's John Kubicek was similarly critical of the episode's subtext, and commented on his growing frustration with the alternate universe: ""If the point is to show us how the Island made everyone a more interesting person, we get it, so please stop before we have to watch another watered-down character wuss out."" Kubicek also criticized the episode's ending, describing the scene shot through the submarine's periscope as ""one of the most ridiculous things Lost has ever done.""[10]",3988,8.5
Recon,6,8,Jack Bender,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Jim Galasso,Sawyer,2010-03-16,8.870000000000001,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recon_(Lost),"""Recon"" is the eighth television episode of the American Broadcasting Company's sixth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 111th episode overall.[2] The episode is written by executive producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and newcomer Jim Galasso and directed by Jack Bender. James ""Sawyer"" Ford is the character the episode is centered on. In 2007, The Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) tasks James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) to recon the Ajira Airways Flight 316 plane and passengers. Meanwhile, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) faces an insane Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin). In a ""flash-sideways"", Detective James Ford's past issues conflict with his present life. The episode received mostly positive reviews, despite it being the lowest-watched episode of the season, with 8.87 million viewers. James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) is a detective for the LAPD, along with his partner Miles Straume (Ken Leung). He is searching for Anthony Cooper, the man who conned his parents, causing his father to kill his mother and then himself (as seen in ""Outlaws""). He has recently traveled to Australia in his search, telling Miles that he was instead in Palm Springs. Miles arranges for Sawyer to go on a blind date with Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader). The two hit it off rather well. However, after having sex, Charlotte discovers Sawyer's folder containing information on Cooper, leading Sawyer to angrily throw her out. Miles confronts Sawyer the next day for lying about going to Australia and decides to stop being Sawyer's partner. After realizing how lonely he is, Sawyer visits Charlotte, who turns him down. Sawyer decides to open up about his past to Miles, right when a car being driven by Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), a fugitive, crashes into his own. He chases her down, leading him to recognize her from their encounter in ""LA X"". Following the events of the episode ""Sundown"", The Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) leads the Others he has recruited, along with Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) and Kate, to rendezvous with his other recruit, Sawyer, who is tending to an injured Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). The Man in Black sends Sawyer on a reconnaissance mission to the smaller Hydra Island to spy on the survivors of Ajira Airways Flight 316. Back at the camp, Claire attempts to kill Kate while Sayid watches impassively, forcing The Man in Black to break up the fight. The Man in Black later explains to Kate that he told Claire the Others took Aaron in order to give Claire something to ""hold on to"". He also compares himself to Aaron, stating that his own mother was crazy. Claire later apologizes to Kate and thanks her for taking care of Aaron. On the Hydra Island, Sawyer finds all the passengers dead and encounters a woman named Zoe (Sheila Kelley), who claims to be the only remaining survivor of Flight 316. Sawyer realizes she is lying; a cavalcade of armed men appear and escort him to their leader, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), who has returned on a submarine. Sawyer makes a deal with Widmore: he will lead the Man in Black into a trap in exchange for safe passage away from the island. Sawyer travels back to the main island and tells the Man in Black about the deal he made, stating that he is loyal to the Man in Black. Sawyer later reveals his true plan to Kate: to turn both sides against each other and escape on the submarine while both sides are distracted. This episode is the first to be written by Jim Galasso. ""Recon"" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregate website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 76 out of 100, indicating ""Generally Favorable Reviews"". The score was down on the previous week's score of 92.[3] Jeff Jenson of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the episode positively, commenting that although it often seemed to function as a ""set-up"" episode, it ""really worked for [him]"" due to the return of Sawyer and ""clever, trickster storytelling where every line seemed to have double meaning and so many scenes seemed pregnant with possibilities for what's really going on.""[4] Raju Mudhar of the Toronto Star agreed that the episode felt like ""mid-game strategic stage setting"", but gave a more negative review than Jensen, deeming Sawyer's off island life ""pretty cliché and boring"" and writing: ""The really terrible thing about it is that it started off so promising.""[5] Sam McPherson of TV Overmind wrote that the episode defied his expectations, but was still less than stellar, preferring the main island storyline to the ""disjointed"" off-island plot. McPherson praised the return of Charlotte, opining that Mader gave a ""fantastic"" performance, and rated the episode ""B+"" overall. He felt that while ""Recon"" had weaknesses in the off-island plot, it was still Lost's best ever Sawyer-centric episode.[6]",3920,7.9
Ab Aeterno,6,9,Tucker Gates,Melinda Hsu Taylor & Greggory Nations,Richard,2010-03-23,9.31,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_Aeterno,"""Ab Aeterno"" is the ninth television episode of the American Broadcasting Company's sixth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 112th episode overall. The episode aired on March 23, 2010.[2] In an extended flashback, after the death of his wife, Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) arrives on the island as a slave on the Black Rock in the 19th century. He then encounters the Man in Black (Titus Welliver) and Jacob (Mark Pellegrino), both of whom offer him different deals in exchange for his allegiance. The title is Latin for ""from eternity"", a phrase used to mean ""since the beginning"" or ""for long ages"" (very loosely translated as ""your life now will be either heaven or hell throughout eternity""); this references the agelessness granted to Richard by Jacob as a reward for his service. ""Ab Aeterno"" was watched by 9 million American viewers and received critical acclaim by critics and audiences alike. Prior to her arrival on the island in 2007, Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) is visited by Jacob in a Russian hospital, where he tells her to protect his remaining candidates (this continues from her flashback in ""The Incident""). Following the events of the episode ""Dr. Linus"", Ilana explains to the group of survivors at the beach that Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) are candidates to replace Jacob, the man in charge of the island, who was recently murdered by Ben. When asked what to do next, she says that Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) knows. Richard, who has become suicidal since Jacob's death, says he does not know and leaves the camp. An extended and uninterrupted series of flashbacks detailing Richard Alpert's origins now begins. They begin in 1867; Alpert, known as Ricardo, lives in Tenerife with his dying wife, Isabella (Mirelly Taylor). He travels to a doctor in order to obtain medicine, but the doctor refuses Ricardo's meager payment, and Ricardo accidentally kills the man when they struggle over the medicine. Ricardo returns home to find that his wife has died, and he is subsequently arrested for murdering the doctor. In prison, he is visited by a priest (Juan Carlos Cantu), who, after learning that Ricardo has been learning English in preparation for beginning a new life in the New World, tells him that he cannot be forgiven and will be hanged. The priest, however, accepts a bribe and allows Ricardo to be taken as a slave to the New World aboard the Black Rock. The ship is caught in a violent storm and a tsunami sweeps it inshore onto the mysterious Island; it crashes through and shatters the (presumably already quite weakened) statue of Taweret, explaining why the statue in the modern day appears to be four-toed (only a leg from the bottom down was left standing), while the Black Rock runs aground into the jungle. The next day, one of the crew members begins executing the captives and is about to execute Ricardo last, but the smoke monster saves Ricardo's life in the nick of time by killing all the workers onboard, leaving Ricardo alone albeit still chained on the boat. As he works to free himself, a vision of his wife appears and tells him that they are in Hell. She is then apparently killed by the Monster. After six grueling days, the Man in Black appears and frees Ricardo. Revealing to Ricardo that he is the black smoke, he claims that Jacob is the devil, and that he has his wife, and that Ricardo must kill Jacob to leave the island and get his wife back. Ricardo attempts to kill Jacob, but is easily outmaneuvered. Jacob explains the function of the island, using a wine bottle as an analogy: the island acts as a cork that ""is the only thing keeping the darkness [literally the wine, metaphorically some unknown embodiment of evil, perhaps even the Man in Black] where it belongs."" Without the ""cork"", the darkness would escape and spread. As the Man in Black sees it, people are inherently evil, while Jacob believes they are inherently good. To this end, Jacob brings people to the island, so that they may disprove the Man in Black; however, he does not believe in telling people what to do, since this would negate their free will to choose good. When Ricardo points out that the Man in Black will corrupt them as he himself was corrupted, Jacob suggests that Ricardo become his representative to the people he brings to the Island. In return, Jacob will offer him a reward of his choice. After having to turn down Ricardo's requests to see his dead wife, and to be absolved for his sins, Jacob grants Ricardo immortality. Ricardo returns to the Man in Black, who states that his offer is still open should Ricardo change his mind. He gives Ricardo the cross necklace that Isabella gave him just before she died, and Ricardo buries it on the island. Back to 2007, Richard visits the site where he has buried his wife's necklace on the island, shouting that he has changed his mind and wishes to join the Man in Black; “Does the offer still stand?” Instead, Hurley arrives and, using his ability to communicate with the dead, acts as an intermediary between Richard and his wife Isabella. She explains that Richard must stop the Man in Black from leaving the island, or else ""we all go to Hell."" The Man in Black, in the form of John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), is shown to be watching them from a distance. In another flashback, Jacob visits the Man in Black and tells him that he will never let him leave the island. The Man in Black insists he'll kill Jacob some day, but Jacob retorts that another will just take his place; the former responds that he will simply kill them too. Jacob then gives him the aforementioned corked wine bottle, which the Man in Black breaks by smashing it against a log. The episode was written by producer Melinda Hsu Taylor and co-producer Greggory Nations and directed by Tucker Gates. The episode is centered on Richard Alpert and is the first episode in season six to return to the old traditional flashback and to not show a ""flash-sideways"". Despite Alpert being the centric character, centric flashbacks are also shown for Ilana Verdansky and The Man in Black (furthermore, Jacob plays large roles in all three characters' backstories). ""Ab Aeterno"" was met with critical acclaim. Review aggregate website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 93 out of 100, indicating ""Universal Acclaim"". The score was up on the previous week's score of 76, making the episode tied for the highest-reviewed episode of the season, along with ""Happily Ever After"".[3]IGN's Chris Carbot highly praised the episode, stating ""the overall story of Lost benefits immensely from the clarity that this week’s episode provides."" Overall, he gave the episode a score of 9.8.[4] Emily VanDerWerff of Los Angeles Times gave the episode a perfect score, calling it ""awesome"" and ""another all-timer for the show.""[5] Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune also praised the episode, stating ""what was great about ""Ab [Aeterno]"" is that it showed us a story about one imperfect, well-intentioned man caught up in this terrible struggle.""[6] Steven Kurutz of The Wall Street Journal deemed it as one of the best hours of TV, ""Richard’s story was so dramatic that I found it totally compelling. Tonight’s show both told a self-contained story and worked within the larger framework of the show by illuminating the power struggle between Jacob and Smokey.""[7] Critics also praised Nestor Carbonell's performance as Richard. Alan Sepinwell of Star Ledger stated ""for three-plus seasons, Richard's been the serene, all-knowing man of mystery, and Carbonell was superb at showing both a cracked, suicidal Richard who has decided he actually knows nothing, and then at showing the very human man he was before Jacob made him immortal.""[8] Chris Carabott called Carbonell's performance ""outstanding.""[9] James Poniewozik of Time thought Carbonell ""made Richard into another character, showing us the decent, desperate, heartbroken man who would be transformed over 140 years as Jacob's ambassador on the Island.""[10]",6349,9.2
The Package,6,10,Paul Edwards,Paul Zbyszewski & Graham Roland,Sun & Jin,2010-03-30,10.129999999999999,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Package_(Lost),"""The Package"" is the tenth television episode of the American Broadcasting Company's sixth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 113th episode overall. The episode was aired on March 30, 2010, on ABC in the United States.[2] The episode was written by producer Paul Zbyszewski and story editor Graham Roland. The episode is centered on Sun-Hwa Kwon and Jin-Soo Kwon. In 2007, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) is captured by Charles Widmore's (Alan Dale) men (unknown to Widmore), leading the Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) to declare war with Widmore. Meanwhile, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) suffers aphasia. In the ""flash-sideways"", Sun & Jin's relationship puts them into harm's way. At the airport, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) is released by security after the incident about his undeclared $25,000 is resolved. His watch is returned, but the money is not, as Jin needs to fill out the paperwork declaring its purpose. Having missed his appointment at the restaurant, he checks into a hotel with Sun-Hwa Paik (Yunjin Kim). In this flash-sideways timeline, Jin and Sun are not a married couple. Instead they have become secretly, romantically involved without the knowledge of Mr. Paik, Sun's father. The next day, Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand), his associate Omar (Anthony Azizi), and translator Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff) arrive at the hotel to collect the watch and the money. Since they lack the money, Sun offers to pay from a private account. Keamy sends her with Mikhail to get the money, but they learn that the account was closed by her father. Meanwhile, Jin is tied up in the storeroom at the restaurant. Keamy reveals that the $25,000 was his payment for killing Jin, as Sun's father found out about his relationship with Sun. After Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) shoots Keamy and his men (shown from his point of view in ""Sundown""), he finds Jin tied up. He hands Jin a box cutter to free himself and leaves. When Mikhail returns with Sun, Jin holds him at gunpoint. Mikhail fights back, and in the ensuing struggle, Jin shoots him fatally in the eye. Sun is also hit by stray fire. As Jin picks Sun up to take her to the hospital, she reveals she is pregnant. On the beach, Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) is waiting for Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) to return, confident that he will know what to do despite his claim otherwise. Meanwhile, Sun, upset by her inability to find Jin, storms off to her garden. There, she is greeted by the Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn), who offers to take her to Jin. Unwilling to trust him, she runs for the beach, knocking herself out against a tree branch on the way. Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) finds her alone, and the head injury has left her unable to speak English, though still able to understand it. Richard returns with Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), having decided on a course of action. Knowing that the plane on the Hydra island is the only means for the Man in Black to escape, he intends to destroy it. Sun is vehemently opposed to the idea, having come to the island in order to retrieve Jin and take him home. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) convinces her that they will find Jin and use the plane to get everyone home. Meanwhile, the Man in Black reveals to Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) that he needs to gather all the remaining candidates, or else he will not be able to leave the island. Before leaving to retrieve Sun, the Man in Black speaks with Sayid Jarrah, who tells him that he is no longer able to experience any sort of emotion whatsoever. When the Man in Black leaves, the camp is attacked by the team hired by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale). They tranquilize the entire group and take Jin to the Hydra island. Jin awakens inside Room 23 and Zoe (Sheila Kelley) shows him a grid map which the Dharma Initiative used to identify pockets of electromagnetism. Knowing that Jin was once a member of Dharma, Zoe asks Jin for his help. However, Jin demands to see Widmore. The Man in Black, accompanied by Sayid, takes a boat to the Hydra island to confront Widmore. When Widmore denies having taken Jin, the Man in Black warns him that war has finally come to the island and returns to his camp. Sayid is left behind to spy on them. Widmore is angry about the fact that Zoe has taken Jin ahead of schedule and orders her to bring the ""package"" from the submarine. Widmore gives Sun's digital camera to Jin, which has photos of his daughter. He explains that he has come to the island to stop the Man in Black from escaping, claiming that everyone they know would ""cease to exist"" should that happen. Widmore then tells Jin that he needs to meet the ""package"", a person who they brought to the island. The episode ends with Sayid spying on Widmore's team in the water, and witnessing a drugged Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) being dragged out of the submarine. ""The Package"" was met with positive reviews. Review aggregate website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 72 out of 100, indicating ""Generally Favorable Reviews"". The score was down on the previous week's score of 93.[3]",3848,7.9
Happily Ever After,6,11,Jack Bender,Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof,Desmond,2010-04-06,9.55,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happily_Ever_After_(Lost),"""Happily Ever After"" is the 11th television episode of the American Broadcasting Company's sixth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 114th episode overall. The episode was aired on April 6, 2010, on ABC in the United States.[2] The episode was written by showrunners and executive producers Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse and directed by Jack Bender. The episode is centered on Desmond Hume. In 2007, Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) undergoes Charles Widmore's (Alan Dale) experiment and interacts with his ""flash-sideways"" counterpart where Desmond, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), and Daniel Widmore (Jeremy Davies) experience visions of their actual-universe counterparts. ""Happily Ever After"" was watched by 9 million American viewers and received critical acclaim by critics and audiences alike, and is widely regarded as one of the best episodes of season six. After being shot by Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) in the episode ""Dead Is Dead"", Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) awakens to discover that Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) has brought him back to the Island. Desmond attacks Charles, who tells him the Island is not done with him, and that unless Desmond helps him, everyone he loves will be gone forever. He has his team prepare an electro-magnetic test, which kills a team member in the path of the toroids as they set up. Desmond is bound to a chair and locked in with the toroids as the test is run. After Desmond survives the test, he agrees to help Charles. As Charles' team leads him away, they are ambushed by Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), who takes a willing Desmond away with him. Desmond arrives in Los Angeles at the behest of his employer, Charles Widmore. After helping the heavily pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) to get her luggage, Desmond goes to Charles' office. Charles informs Desmond that his son Daniel Widmore (Jeremy Davies), a classical musician, has invited the rock band Drive Shaft to perform alongside him that evening. The band's bass guitarist, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), has been arrested for possessing drugs, and Charles requires Desmond to collect and deliver him to Daniel's event. Upon their meeting, Charlie tells Desmond that he recently almost died after swallowing a bag of heroin (As seen in ""LA X""), and in his near-death state experienced an intense, blissful vision in which he was with a blonde woman. He causes Desmond to crash his car into a nearby marina, and while Desmond attempts to rescue Charlie from the water, he too experiences a vision, seeing Charlie drowning with the words ""Not Penny's Boat"" written on his palm. The two are taken to a hospital, where Desmond has a short series of visions of Penny (Sonya Walger), a stranger to him, during an MRI test. After discharging himself from the hospital, Desmond apologizes to Charles' wife Eloise Widmore (Fionnula Flanagan) for being unable to ensure the attendance of Drive Shaft. Nearby employees are discussing the guest-list for Daniel's concert, and Desmond hears the name Penny mentioned. Eloise refuses to let him see the list, and warns him off of pursuing his inquiries. As Desmond prepares to leave, he is stopped by Daniel, who tells him that he recently saw a red-haired woman in a local museum that he strongly felt he already knew and loved. Daniel states that after the encounter, he made a series of notes in his journal which a mathematician friend has identified as advanced quantum mechanics, a topic he knows nothing about. Daniel shows his notes which contain a graph with imaginary time on one axis, and hypotheses that the world as he and Desmond are experiencing is not their correct path, and something massive, like a nuclear explosion, has altered their realities. Desmond questions Daniel as to whether he intends to set off a nuclear bomb, to which Daniel replies he believes he already has. Daniel tells Desmond that Penny is his half-sister, and tells him where he can find her. Desmond locates Penny running the steps of an athletics stadium, and introduces himself. After shaking Penny's hand, Desmond passes out. When he awakens, he asks Penny out for coffee, an invitation which she accepts. As his driver George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) takes him to their meeting point, Desmond asks him to acquire the flight manifest for Oceanic 815, the flight which brought him to Los Angeles. When Minkowski asks why he needs it, Desmond responds, ""I just need to show them something"". ""Happily Ever After"" was met with critical acclaim.

The title alludes to the season two episode ""Everybody Hates Hugo."" The episode is centered on Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes, while Desmond Hume and John Locke also received points of view in the flash-sideways universe. In 2007, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) starts to think blowing up the plane that carried Ajira Airways Flight 316 is a bad idea. Meanwhile, Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) arrives at the Man in Black's (Terry O'Quinn) camp. In the flash-sideways, Desmond encourages Hurley to believe Libby Smith's (Cynthia Watros) visions of the other timeline. Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) is a successful businessman and philanthropist. His mother sets him up on a blind date, but instead of his intended date, he meets Libby Smith (Cynthia Watros), who tells him that they already know one another. Libby is led away by her doctor (Bruce Davison), who explains that she is a resident at a psychiatric institution and has wandered away from a group trip. Later, Hurley meets Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who encourages him to believe Libby, and to find out why she thinks she knows him already. Hurley then visits the Santa Rosa Mental Health Institute, where Libby tells him that she remembers them meeting following a plane crash on an island. Hurley is unable to remember, but asks her on a date regardless. They share a picnic, and when Libby kisses him, Hurley begins to remember. Desmond observes their date from a distance, before driving off and visiting the school at which Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) teach. Desmond sees Locke in his wheelchair, and after a short conversation with Ben, he runs Locke over with his car and drives off. While visiting Libby's grave, Hurley is visited by Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), who warns him that if the group follows through with their plan to blow up the plane on Hydra Island, many people will die and it will be Hurley's fault. Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) collects four sticks of dynamite from the Black Rock. As Hurley voices his concern, Ilana puts down her bag, containing the unstable dynamite, too hard causing it to explode, killing her. Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) leads the group to collect more dynamite. Hurley sneaks off ahead of them and blows up the Black Rock, destroying the dynamite supply, as well as the ship. He claims that Jacob has appeared to him and told him to take the group to The Man in Black. Richard does not believe him, and remains intent on destroying the plane. He takes Ben and Miles (Ken Leung) with him to the Barracks to collect explosives, while Jack (Matthew Fox), Frank (Jeff Fahey) and Sun (Yunjin Kim) remain with Hurley. Hurley confesses to Jack that he did not really see Jacob, but Jack tells he already knows, and is willing to follow Hurley anyway. The group hears whispers from the jungle, and Michael appears again, explaining that the whispers are the voices of deceased island inhabitants who are unable to move on. He apologizes to Hurley for killing Libby. Meanwhile, Sayid presents Desmond to The Man in Black, who takes him to an old well. The Man in Black explains to Desmond that people built wells looking for the source that made compass needles spin at points like this location. The Man in Black then throws Desmond down the well. Upon returning to his camp, Hurley's group arrives to talk to the Man in Black. ""Everybody Loves Hugo"" was met with positive reviews.

The Last Recruit,6,13,Stephen Semel,Paul Zbyszewski & Graham Roland,various,2010-04-20,9.53,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Recruit,"""The Last Recruit"" is the 13th television episode of the American Broadcasting Company's sixth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 116th episode overall. The episode was aired on April 20, 2010, on ABC in the United States. The episode was written by producer Paul Zbyszewski and story editor Graham Roland and directed by editor Stephen Semel.[2] Although the episode is not specifically centered on someone, Jack Shephard, Sun-Hwa Kwon, Claire Littleton, Jin-Soo Kwon, John Locke, Sayid Jarrah and James ""Sawyer"" Ford have points of view in the flash-sideways universe. In the flash-sideways timeline, multiple revelations occur: Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and his son, David (Dylan Minnette), meet his half-sister Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin); Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) is captured by Detectives James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Miles Straume (Ken Leung); Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) enter the same hospital. In 2007, upon the arrival of Hurley's (Jorge Garcia) group, Sawyer double-crosses The Man in Black (also O'Quinn) and initiates his plan, bringing Kate (Evangeline Lilly), Claire and Hurley's group in the process. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is rushed to the hospital after being run over by Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) in ""Everybody Loves Hugo"". Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) is taken to the same hospital, and upon seeing Locke, she seems to remember him and becomes frightened. In the police station, James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) interrogates Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly). Kate is able to see through Sawyer that he didn't arrest her at LAX because he didn't want anyone to know he was in Australia. Miles Straume (Ken Leung) calls Sawyer over about the multiple homicide at a restaurant of Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and three of his associates. Miles shows Sawyer a surveillance image, which shows Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) leaving the scene. Desmond meets Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) while she is on her way to another adoption meeting. Remembering each other from the airport, he persuades her to meet his lawyer for the well being of her child, and he promises it will not cost her. Upon introducing herself to the lawyer, Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson), Claire is told that she has been looking for her. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) also turns up at the office with his son, and learns that Claire is his half-sister and is also a beneficiary of their father (John Terry)'s will. Jack then gets an urgent call from the hospital and has to reschedule. Sayid arrives at Nadia (Andrea Gabriel)'s house and attempts to leave, but is apprehended by Sawyer and Miles. Sun wakes up, and Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) informs her that the baby is okay. As Jack is preparing to operate on Locke, he recognizes him. Following the events of ""Everybody Loves Hugo"", The Man in Black asks Jack to speak with him, admitting to impersonating Jack's father since Jack first arrived on the island. Claire interrupts, and The Man in Black leaves the two to catch up with each other. Zoe (Sheila Kelley) arrives and demands to have Desmond returned. If they refuse, she'll have the camp destroyed by mortars, which she demonstrates by having her camp fire a single round nearby. The Man in Black gives Sawyer a map to a boat and asks to meet at a rendezvous point where he will be waiting with the rest of the camp. However, Sawyer is planning on betraying the Man in Black by making his deal with Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), and he tells Jack to bring Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), and Sun along to a different point as they are all leaving. Sawyer and Kate then take off and find the boat. The Man in Black tells Sayid to kill Desmond if he still wants Nadia back. Sayid goes to the well, where he finds Desmond at the bottom. He tells Desmond that the Man in Black promised to bring the woman who died in his arms back to life, and believes him capable of this because Sayid himself was brought back. As the Man in Black's group travels to the point where Sawyer is supposed to pick them up, the Man in Black finds Sayid, and questions whether he killed Desmond. Sayid claims he has. Jack sneaks away with Hurley, Sun and Lapidus, but Claire sees them and follows. Once they reach the boat, Claire holds them at gunpoint, but Kate convinces her to join them. Once on the boat, Jack tells Sawyer that leaving the island is a mistake, and jumps into the sea. After swimming back ashore, he sees the Man in Black and the rest of the group are waiting. On Hydra island, Sun is reunited with Jin and she regains her ability to speak English. However, Widmore betrays Sawyer and has artillery shells fired in an effort to kill the Man in Black. Jack is injured by an explosion on the beach and the Man in Black carries him into the jungle. The Man in Black then tells Jack not to worry, as he is with him now. The episode received mostly positive reviews. Review aggregate website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 73 out of 100, indicating ""Generally Favorable Reviews"".

The Candidate,6,14,Jack Bender,Elizabeth Sarnoff & Jim Galasso,Jack & Locke,2010-05-04,9.59,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Candidate_(Lost),"""The Candidate"" is the 14th episode of the American Broadcasting Company's sixth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 117th episode overall. The episode aired on May 4, 2010, on ABC in the United States.[2] The episode was written by Elizabeth Sarnoff and Jim Galasso and directed by Jack Bender. The episode is centered on Jack Shephard and John Locke. In the flash-sideways timeline, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) tries to find out how John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) was paralyzed. In 2007, Jack and his group betray the Man in Black (also O'Quinn), but not without falling into his plans. After being successfully operated on by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) awakens at the hospital. Jack tells Locke that he may be a candidate for a new surgical treatment to repair his pre-existing paralysis and asks Locke how he wound up in his paraplegic state. However, Locke declines the offer. In order to find out more about Locke's paralysis, Jack visits dentist Dr. Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) and asks for the dental records from an emergency oral surgery performed on Locke about three years previously. Bernard refuses to breach confidentiality, but tells him that a man named Anthony Cooper (Kevin Tighe) was brought in along with Locke three years ago. Jack goes to a nursing home and visits Anthony Cooper, who is Locke's father in a vegetative state. Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) arrives at the hospital to see Jack. She shows Jack a music box that their father (John Terry) said he especially wanted her to have. Jack then invites Claire to come and stay at his house, stating to Claire that they are not strangers, but rather family. As Locke is preparing to leave the hospital, Jack approaches him and tells him that he went to see Locke's father so that he could find out why he doesn't want the surgery. Locke reveals to Jack that the accident that made him paralyzed was a plane crash; he had just qualified for his pilot's license and his father was his first passenger. Jack tells Locke his father is ""gone"" and that punishing himself won't bring him back. Locke still refuses Jack's offer and leaves. Following the events of ""The Last Recruit"", Jack awakens on Hydra Island with Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) by his side. The Man in Black arrives and tells them that James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), Claire Littleton, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), Hugo Reyes (Jorge Garcia), Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) have been taken prisoner by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale). The Man in Black plans to help them escape, run for the Ajira plane and leave the island before Widmore knows what is happening. While Jack agrees to help, he insists that he himself will not leave the island. At Hydra Station, Widmore has Sawyer's group thrown inside the animal cages. Sayid turns off the camp's generator, bringing down the sonar fences which had been keeping the Man in Black at bay. The Man in Black then attacks as the Smoke monster, allowing Jack to free Sawyer's group. After reuniting with Sayid, they head into the jungle to find the Ajira plane. The Man in Black arrives at the plane site before the group, and inspects the interior of the plane after killing Widmore's guards. The Man in Black reveals to the group that Widmore has rigged the plane with C4. Unable to take the risk of using the plane, the Man in Black decides to escape using Widmore's submarine. As they head to the docks, Sawyer asks Jack to stop the Man in Black from getting on board the sub. At the docks, the survivors manage to board the submarine while Widmore's men attack from the jungle. Kate is shot during the ensuing gun fight, but Jack manages to get her on board after pushing the Man in Black into the water. He gets back out of the water and begins to shoot down the last of Widmore's men. In order to prevent the Man in Black from entering, Sawyer has the sub take off without Claire. On the sub, Jack discovers the Man in Black has planted the C4 in his bag and has set a timer to detonate. Unable to reach the surface in time, Sayid attempts to defuse the bomb. However, Jack tells Sawyer to let the timer reach zero, believing that nothing will happen to them because the Man in Black is unable to kill them himself. Jack theorizes that the Man in Black united the candidates because he needed them all dead in order to leave the island, and has come up with a plan that will trick them into killing one another by mistrusting each other. Sawyer is unconvinced and pulls the bomb's wires, causing the speed of the bomb's countdown to accelerate. Sayid tells Jack where to find Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) and runs to the back of the sub with the bomb. The bomb detonates, killing Sayid and causing a massive explosion that proceeds to flood the sub. Frank is knocked out by a door as it gives way to the water. Sun is pinned down by fragments of the submarine. Hurley exits the sub with a wounded Kate, while Jin, Sawyer, and Jack try to help Sun. After Sawyer is knocked unconscious, Jin convinces Jack to leave with Sawyer. Jin continues to try to free Sun despite her pleas for him to go, but to no avail. He tells Sun that he won't leave her. They then embrace as water floods the submarine, drowning them while holding hands. Jack, Sawyer, Kate, and Hurley regroup at a nearby beach, and mourn those who died. Meanwhile, at the docks, the Man in Black tells Claire that the sub has sunk and there are survivors. He then departs to ""finish what [he] started."" The episode features the deaths of at least 3 main cast members,[3] the highest of any episode in the series. Showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse described the episode as ""brutal"". Regarding the mass deaths of the characters, Lindelof stated ""now you know this show is willing and capable of killing anyone."" Cuse also added ""There is no ambiguity. [The Man In Black] is evil and he has to be stopped... When we watched the death scenes ourselves, it was brutal. [But] the story always comes first.""[4] The episode received critical acclaim. Review aggregate website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 92 out of 100, indicating ""Universal Acclaim"".

Alan Sepinwall of Star Ledger thought the episode ""drastically accelerated the pace of the unhappy endings.""[10] Chris Carbot stated ""Sayid's death was a fitting end to his story. He had been on course to redeem himself ever since switching over to Team Smokie and was thankfully given the opportunity to go out in grand fashion ... Jin and Sun's demise came as a total shock.

The episode aired on May 11, 2010, on ABC in the United States.[2] The episode was written by Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof and directed by Tucker Gates. The episode is centered on Jacob and The Man in Black. This episode is the second in the season that does not feature a ""flash-sideways."" The episode, unlike most Lost episodes, does not divide its time between two different time settings, but takes place entirely in the past, except for a brief scene at the end from the season one episode ""House of the Rising Sun."" It depicts the origins of the characters of Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) and his brother, The Man in Black (Titus Welliver), and how they came to be on the island. It also reveals the identities of the corpses discovered in the cave in ""House of the Rising Sun."" It is the only episode of the series in which none of the series regulars appears, except in the flashback sequence. This is the only episode where the Man in Black appears in his original, human form. In all of his other appearances, he is either in his smoke form or in the form of a dead person. Although he appears in his own form in ""The Incident"" and ""Ab Aeterno"", this was an imitation of his original form which by that point was dead. This episode is notable for receiving a widely mixed opinion, with many commentators alternately considering one of the best or worst episodes of the series. Washed ashore on the island, a pregnant woman named Claudia (Lela Loren) encounters an unnamed woman (Allison Janney); both speak Latin. The woman helps Claudia give birth to her son, whom she names Jacob. Another boy is born, unexpectedly. The woman kills Claudia and raises the twins as her own, trying to keep them ignorant of the outside world. She also teaches them to be distrustful of humanity, which she regards as corrupt and dangerous. At age 13, Jacob's brother (the future Man in Black) finds a Senet game, containing polished black and white pieces. Jacob (Kenton Duty) asks about the box and his brother (Ryan Bradford) asks him to keep it secret from the woman, but she sees through Jacob. The woman confronts Jacob's brother and claims that she left the box for him; she allays the accusation by telling the young boy that he is ""special."" He suggests that the box came from somewhere else, to which the woman responds, ""There is nowhere else."" When the young Man in Black persists in asking about his origins, the woman explains that she came from her own mother, who is now dead, adding that the boys will never need to worry about death. After following a boar some distance from their camp, Jacob and his brother discover other people on the island. The woman warns the brothers that the other people ""are not like us. We are here for a reason."" She reluctantly decides to show the brothers a mysterious tunnel filled with light and an underground stream. She tells them that one of them will eventually be its caretaker, and that she has made them incapable of harming each other. The woman explains that the light must be kept secret, and is highly coveted. She finally warns, ""If the light goes out here, it goes out everywhere."" Soon after, the brothers are playing the game and Jacob is frustrated at his brother's selfish rules. Suddenly, a vision of Claudia appears to the young Man in Black. She reveals herself as their birth mother, and claims that the other people came to the island with her. The young Man in Black confronts the woman about Claudia's claims, and attempts to convince Jacob to join the other people on the island with him. However, Jacob refuses and stays with the woman. Over the course of the next 30 years, Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) visits his brother (Titus Welliver) at the camp he shares with the other people. The Man in Black reveals that together with other scientifically curious men, they have discovered a way to leave the island by harnessing its strange properties. This was accomplished by digging wells in spots where ""metal behaves strangely."" The Man in Black invites Jacob to leave with him, but Jacob declines. When the woman hears of what the Man in Black is doing, she visits him and learns that he and the others have constructed a giant wheel down a well. He tells her that his people have dug into the light from other locations on the island, and that they plan to create a system that will allow them to leave. Upon hearing this, she renders the Man in Black unconscious. When he awakens, he discovers the people in the camp massacred, and the well completely filled in. Meanwhile, the woman shows Jacob the tunnel of light again, explaining that it leads to ""the heart of the island,"" and that Jacob is to succeed her in taking care of it. She also warns Jacob never to enter the tunnel, warning of a fate worse than death. Jacob reluctantly drinks a wine that the woman pours, and she proclaims, ""Now you and I are the same."" Enraged by her actions, the Man in Black stabs the woman in her camp through the back and asks why she wouldn't let him leave the island. She replies that she loves him, and, relieved and calm, thanks him and dies. Jacob retaliates by beating his brother, and throws him into the tunnel of light. The smoke monster emerges in his place. Jacob then finds the Man in Black's physical body and places it with the woman's in the cave where she lived, along with a pouch containing the black and white stones they used in the game. In a repeat of a scene from the first season, now in a new context, the corpses and stones are found centuries later by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), and dubbed Adam and Eve by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn). ""Across the Sea"" is one of the most polarizing episodes of Lost. Writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse said on their podcast that even they were shocked by fans' reaction to the episode, stating they had received comments ranging from saying ""This is one of the best episodes ever"" to ""You ruined Lost"". The episode received mixed reviews from critics, and a divided reaction from fans. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 58 out of 100, indicating ""Mixed or Average Reviews"". The score was down on the previous episode's score of 92 and is the lowest rated episode of the season.[3] Teresa Kiessling of NPD, said ""Now we just need to learn the origin of their Mother,"" and indicated that the episode did little to satisfy viewer's curiosity surrounding the origins of Jacob and Man In Black. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club stated ""I have only one real criticism of “Across The Sea,” and it's that when Lost deals directly with the transcendental—rather than just glancing at it—the show can get awfully gooey, and painfully blunt.""[4] Emily VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times wrote, ""One part of me, the TV critic part, the part that dissects these things and picks them apart and looks for things to dislike about them, mostly really liked the episode, aside from a few niggling points.""[5] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly stated ""Across The Sea"" was ""an unconventional outing that deserves props for benching its stars to give us a story that felt absolutely necessary for establishing the Big Picture context for the final act that is at last upon us.""[6] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a score of 6.8, saying that he felt frustrated that at this point of the show, it isn't giving many answers.[7] Some critics were very disappointed with the episode. James Poniewozik of Time stated ""'Across the Sea' took a series that is deeply and richly psychological and character-based and moved it into the realm of the allegorical.""[8] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune stated ""For a lot of reasons, this was not an episode that goes in the Win column. It was actually seriously disappointing, if not disheartening.""[9]",5155,8.2
What They Died For,6,16,Paul Edwards,Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz & Elizabeth Sarnoff,various,2010-05-18,10.47,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_They_Died_For,"""What They Died For"" is the 16th and penultimate episode of the American Broadcasting Company's final season of the serial drama television series Lost and 119th and penultimate episode overall. The episode aired on May 18, 2010, on ABC in the United States.[2] The episode's flash-sideways are centered on Jack Shephard, Desmond Hume, Benjamin Linus and James ""Sawyer"" Ford. In the flash-sideways timeline, Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) continues his attempt to gather all the passengers of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. In 2007, The Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) devises a new strategy. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) takes the role as leader of the island while he and his group search for Desmond. In the flash sideways timeline, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and David Shephard (Dylan Minnette) eat breakfast and discuss David's participation in a concert that night. Jack is notified that Oceanic Airlines have found Christian Shephard's coffin; unbeknownst to him, this is a ruse planned by Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick). Outside the school where he and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) work, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) sees and confronts Desmond, who beats him while explaining that his intent was to make Locke ""let go"". Ben experiences flashes of Desmond beating him in the original universe. Ben relates all this to Locke, who goes to see Jack at the hospital and decides to have the new procedure; he believes his experiences with Desmond and Jack have been fated. Alex's (Tania Raymonde) mother, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), offers the visibly injured Ben a ride home. She invites him to dinner, where Rousseau tells Ben that he has become like a father to Alex since her real father's death. Desmond enters James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Miles Straume's (Ken Leung) police station, confesses to assaulting Locke and Ben, and is jailed alongside Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews). The three prisoners are to be transported by van, but the driver, Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), releases them and receives a payoff from Desmond and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia). Desmond hands Kate a dress and tells her they are going to a concert. After the submarine explosion in ""The Candidate"", Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sawyer wash ashore, alive. Jack determines they must find Desmond, whose importance is revealed by the Man in Black's (Terry O'Quinn) attempt to kill him. A younger Jacob (Kenton Duty) confronts Hurley, demanding his body's ashes. Hurley gives them to him, and Jacob leaves without answering any of Hurley's questions. Hurley chases him to a campfire, where the adult Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) instructs him to bring the others before the campfire burns out, which will end his ability to manifest as he poured his ashes into the fire. They arrive in time, and are all able to see Jacob for the first time. He explains that they were chosen to come to the island because each of them has an emptiness that can be filled by the island, and that one of them must choose to be the guardian who will protect the light, the ""heart"" of the island, from the Man in Black. Jack volunteers; Jacob gives Jack a drink of water and declares that Jack is ""now like [him]"". Ben, Miles, and Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) reach the destroyed Barracks of the DHARMA Initiative. Ben enters the secret room where he was previously seen summoning the smoke monster, where he kept a stack of C4 that he was going to use to destroy the Ajira airplane to prevent the Man in Black's escape. Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) and Zoe (Sheila Kelley) confront Ben, and Charles claims to be the group's only hope. Zoe and Widmore hide when the Man in Black arrives, while Miles flees. The smoke monster, the Man in Black, attacks Richard. Then, as Locke, he demands Widmore's location from Ben, who reveals it. The Man in Black kills Zoe when it becomes clear she will not talk, then threatens Widmore with harm to Penny unless he reveals his purpose on the island. Widmore whispers a response, but Ben shoots and kills him to deny him the opportunity to save his daughter. The Man in Black claims to have already gotten the information he wanted, and leaves with Ben. They find that Desmond has apparently escaped the well by climbing a rope, but the Man in Black says this will not prevent him from using what he learned from Widmore: he can use Desmond's resistance to electromagnetism to destroy the island. The episode was shown for approximately 1800 people at UCLA's Royce Hall on May 13, 2010 as a fundraiser for scholarships for the Colburn School of Performing Arts.[3][4] It was written by executive producers Edward Kitsis, Adam Horowitz and Elizabeth Sarnoff and directed by Paul Edwards. 1.87 million Canadians watched this episode.[5] 10.17 million American viewers watched this episode,[6] the highest viewed episode since ""The Package"".[7] The episode received critical acclaim. Review aggregate website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 89 out of 100, indicating ""Universal Acclaim"".[8] Both Cindy McLennan and Sam McPherson of Television Without Pity and TV Overmind, respectively, gave the episode a perfect score.[9][10] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.4, naming the episode ""A fantastic setup for the series finale.""[11] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club stated ""It was funny at times, poignant at times, shocking at times, and it made the overall picture a little bit clearer. And I especially liked the way the tone shifted as the episode progressed."" In total, he gave the episode the score of 91.[12] Emily VanDerWerff of Los Angeles Times gave the episode a score of 90, stating, ""What They Died For is a lot of things. It's a fantastic episode of ""Lost,"" one that moves like a rocket. It's a big, relatively well-handled infodump that makes sure we know how everything and everyone fits into the big picture, mostly.""[13] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode the score of 80, saying that it was ""A set-up episode, albeit an extremely entertaining one.""[14]",4571,8.7
The End,6,17,Jack Bender,Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse,various,2010-05-23,13.57,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_(Lost),"""The End"" is the series finale of the television series Lost, consisting of the 17th and 18th episodes of season 6. It is also the 120th and 121st episodes overall of the series. It aired on ABC in the United States on May 23, 2010. In the episode, the Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) executes his plan to destroy the island as Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) tries to stop him once and for all. Meanwhile, the true nature of this season's ""flash-sideways"" narrative device is revealed. The finale was written by co-creator/executive producer Damon Lindelof and executive producer Carlton Cuse, and directed by executive producer Jack Bender. Unlike the previous season finales, which were two hours long with advertisements, the series finale was expanded by half an hour, running two and a half hours starting at 9 pm ET, with a retrospective of the past six seasons running for two hours, starting at 7 pm. ""The End"" was watched by 13.5 million Americans and received a polarized response from both fans and critics. Reviewers from the Chicago Tribune and IGN called it the best episode of the season and praised its emotion and character. Reviews from the Los Angeles Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer criticized the finale for answering so few of the series' questions. Web site Metacritic gave ""The End"" a score of 74 out of 100, suggesting ""mostly positive reviews"", while The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph reported mixed and ""lukewarm"" reviews. Retrospective reviews have been equally polarizing.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8] Desmond gathers many of the islanders at the benefit concert of Daniel Widmore (Jeremy Davies) and Drive Shaft. One by one, each protagonist begins to recognize one another based on close contact with a person or object that was important to them throughout their time on the island, receiving flashes of memory. Eventually, most of them remember their past lives and are drawn to the church that was to be the site of Jack's father's funeral. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) regains the use of his legs after being successfully operated on by Jack. After remembering his time on the island through the flashes of memory, Locke attempts to convince Jack of the truth, but Jack, although also experiencing flashes of memory, resists the revelation. Locke later meets Ben outside the church where Locke forgives him for murdering him. Ben then meets Hurley, who says everyone is inside, motioning him to join them, but Ben elects to stay outside. As Hurley heads back inside, he says to Ben that he was a ""real good number two..."", to which Ben replies back that Hurley was a ""great number one"". Kate later encounters Jack, and while her presence causes him to experience more flashes, he continues to resist. She takes him to the church and instructs him to enter through the back door, telling him the others will be waiting for him. In the church, he enters a room where there are symbols not just of Christianity, but also of other faiths such as Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, etc. He then encounters his father's coffin. He opens the coffin lid and discovers it to be empty. Christian Shephard (John Terry) then appears behind him. Jack slowly comes to realize that he is dead as well. After an emotional embrace, Christian reassures him that the events leading up to now actually happened and the time he spent with the people on the island was ""the most important period"" of his life. He explains to Jack that time has no meaning in this place and that they ""made"" the place to ""find each other"", independent of the time at which they died. Christian explains that place exists so the Oceanic 815 survivors could ""let go"" and ""move on"" together. Jack and Christian go out into the church to meet the others. Everyone is able to see, recognize, and remember everyone else and their lives together. After an emotional reunion, Christian opens the front doors, revealing another bright light that slowly envelops everyone inside the church. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) head to the heart of the island, while James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway) goes after Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who was thrown into a well. Arriving there, Sawyer is confronted by Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) and the Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn), who reveals his plan to destroy the island. Sawyer then steals Ben's rifle and reunites with Jack's group. Jack then tells Sawyer that he plans to confront the Man in Black. At the same time, Desmond, having been rescued by Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell) and Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson), is confronted by the Man in Black, who has Ben with him. The Man in Black threatens to kill Rose and Bernard if Desmond does not come with him, and he complies, provided the Man in Black leaves the couple unharmed. Meanwhile, Miles Straume (Ken Leung) finds a no longer ageless Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) in the jungle, and they set out by boat to destroy the Ajira plane which would allow the Man in Black to escape. Along the way, they rescue Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), who had survived the destruction of the submarine, and they decide to leave the island by using the plane. On the way to the heart of the Island, Jack's group encounters the Man in Black's group. Jack tells the Man in Black that he is going to kill him, and together with Desmond, they travel to the heart of the Island. Jack tells Sawyer that he believes Desmond can kill the Man in Black because he thinks Jacob brought him back not as bait but as a weapon. Desmond tells Jack that destroying the island and killing the Man in Black do not matter because he is going down to the heart of the island and leaving for another place. Jack and the Man in Black lower Desmond down to the heart of the island and he reaches a chamber, leading to a glowing pool with an elongated stone at its center. Immune to the pool's electromagnetic energy, Desmond manages to remove the giant stone stopper in the center of the pool. However, the light goes out and the pool dries up, setting about the destruction of the island which the Man in Black predicted. A result of Desmond's act is an unforeseen side-effect of making the Man in Black mortal again. During a prolonged fight, the Man in Black stabs Jack in the same spot where his appendix was taken out and almost kills him when Kate shoots the Man in Black in the back, allowing Jack to kick him off the cliff to his death. The island continues to crumble and Jack realizes that he has to restore the light of the heart of the Island. He tells Kate to get Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) on the plane and leave the island in case he fails. The two profess their love for each other and Kate leaves with Sawyer while Hurley and Ben follow Jack back to the pool. Kate and Sawyer travel to Hydra Island via Desmond's boat Elizabeth, to the site of the Ajira Airlines plane where Lapidus, Richard, and Miles have been quickly trying to make it air-worthy. Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer, and Claire board the plane, Lapidus successfully gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and walks toward the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly closes his eyes as he dies. Damon Lindelof, producer, reported on his Twitter page that the finale completed shooting in Hawaii on April 24, 2010, exactly six years after filming was completed on the show's pilot.[10] When interviewed about the finale, Carlton Cuse stated that it had a real, definite resolution instead of ""'a snow globe, waking up in bed, it's all been a dream, cut to black' kind of ending,"" referencing the series finales of St. Elsewhere, Newhart, and The Sopranos, respectively.[11] Only Fox and O'Quinn's scripts explained the nature of the Sideways world; Lindelof and Cuse explained its meaning to the others while filming the church scene, the last time the cast members were together.[12] They have expressed satisfaction regarding the finale; Daniel Dae Kim stated ""If you think about how many pieces the writers had to put together in order to make it fall into place, it’s mind-boggling, and they did such a great job... For me it was very satisfying. After I read it, I had to sit for five or 10 minutes, just reflecting and digesting, because it definitely makes an impact.""[13] Emerson said: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} I have received the finale by degrees. I read the script without the secret scenes, then I read the secret scenes, then I shot the script and each time I’m thinking about 'what does this mean?' When I first read it, the ending wasn’t clear to me – but since then it’s grown more clear and I have to say, grown more satisfying the more I think about it. I expect a mixture of satisfaction and consternation amongst the viewers when it airs. But once they rewatch it, rethink about it and possibly look at the saga again, gradually they will feel like they have just read a good novel—but you have to chew on it for a while.[9] Carbonell described the finale as being ""all about everyone’s resolutions.""[14] Cusick said ""There are so many walks of life getting together to talk about the show and so many issues to be brought up and that's exactly what the ending will bring up. People will be talking about it for weeks afterwards and that's what the show has always done.""[15] Instead of being displayed along with ABC promotional material (which in most cases would consist of a preview of the next Lost episode), the finale's closing credits are shown alongside various shots of the Oceanic 815 plane wreckage. However, this footage was not added by the producers of the show and is not considered a part of the actual episode. ABC independently decided to add the footage as a soft, nostalgic transition between the final scene and upcoming local news broadcast.[16] After the finale, a post-finale special of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, titled Jimmy Kimmel Live: Aloha to Lost, aired at 12:05 am, showing three alternate endings, which turned out to be finale spoofs from Survivor, The Sopranos, and Newhart.[17] An ABC source reported that the DVD and Blu-ray release of season six will feature twenty minutes of additional scenes, some of which will have answers to questions, cut from the storyline because of running time.[18] All former series regulars who appear (Jeremy Davies, Maggie Grace, Rebecca Mader, Elizabeth Mitchell, Dominic Monaghan, Ian Somerhalder, Cynthia Watros) are restored to the main cast in this episode. Those who do not return are Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Malcolm David Kelley, Harold Perrineau, Michelle Rodriguez, Kiele Sanchez, and Rodrigo Santoro (Rodriguez appeared in the previous episode). Additionally, long-time recurring guest stars Sam Anderson, L. Scott Caldwell, François Chau (incidentally, it's the first time Chau was credited for his appearance), Fionnula Flanagan, John Terry and Sonya Walger are upgraded to the main cast. Despite being killed off in the twelfth episode of the season and reprising her role only once more in the thirteenth, cast member Zuleikha Robinson received an on-screen, main cast credit for every episode. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje turned down an offer to return because of salary disagreements.[19] Despite the fact that it was earlier reported by Carlton Cuse that Malcolm David Kelley would appear,[20] he only appeared in archive footage. The episode was initially broadcast on ABC in the eastern United States[21] and CTV in eastern Canada, then simultaneously[22] in the western United States, Western Canada, Fox in Italy and Portugal, Fox and Cuatro in Spain, DiziMax in Turkey and Sky1 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, HOT 3 in Israel at 9 pm Pacific Time on May 23, 2010.[23][24][25] Because of the time difference, its initial Spain simulcast airing was at 6 am (5 am in the UK) BST. In Ireland, RTÉ Two decided to air it on Monday, May 24 at 9 pm rather than its usual Thursday night slot in the interest of fans who did not want the ending to be spoiled.[26] ABC charged up to US$900,000 for a 30-second commercial during the May 23 U.S. broadcast.[27] Its broadcast on Cleveland ABC affiliate WEWS-TV was almost completely interrupted and rendered unwatchable by a number of technical difficulties with the station's digital signal. This caused numerous viewer complaints, leading the station to issue numerous apologies both on-air and on WEWS's website.[28] In its original American broadcast, ""The End"" was viewed by 13.5 million households with a 5.8 rating/15% share in the 18–49 demographic, coming first in every time slot and boosting ABC to the highest rated network on Sunday. The best rated half-hour (the last one) was viewed by 15.31 million viewers and earned a 6.4 rating/19% share in the 18–49 demographic.[29] At least 20.5 million viewers watched at least six minutes of the episode according to ABC.[30] After its first broadcast, the series finale became the 55th highest viewed series finale ever in the United States. Entertainment Weekly's Michael Ausiello called the ratings ""Solid, not spectacular"". According to Ausiello, even though it was the show's highest rated episode in two years, it was still ""far from a record-breaking performance"".[31] In the UK, 584,000 viewers tuned in to see the episode on Sky 1 during a 5 am broadcast. A later broadcast the following night was viewed by approximately 2.5 million.[32] In Canada, viewers averaged over two million with the 7 pm special and the two-hour finale.[33] ""The End"" provoked an immediate response, and received a strongly polarized reaction from both fans and TV critics alike. Response to the episode was positive and negative in equal measures, both in the United States and internationally. According to the web site Metacritic, ""The End"" received ""generally favorable reviews"" with a Metascore – a weighted average based on the impressions of 31 critical reviews – of 74 out of 100.[34] Of the most positive reviews, IGN writer Chris Carbot gave the episode a score of 10/10, describing it as ""one of the most enthralling, entertaining and satisfying conclusions [he] could have hoped for.""[35] Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times also gave ""The End"" a perfect score, calling it ""emotional, funny [and] expertly measured"".[36] Robert Bianco of USA Today rated the finale as perfect as well, stating that it could ""stand with the best any series has produced"".[37] James Poniewozik of Time also praised ""The End"", calling it ""full of heart and commitment"";[38]Zap2it's Ryan McGee described the episode as ""a masterpiece.""[39] Jason Hughes of TV Squad felt that ""as finales go, 'The End' will definitely go down as one of the more satisfying ones"".[40] Emily VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times felt that the episode ""provides character payoffs we’ve been waiting for. ... The important thing ... is not answers. It’s resolution. And 'Lost' provided that in spades.""[41]Richard Roeper gave the episode an A+ rating, calling it a ""great finale to one of the best TV shows of all time.""[42] Not all critics were satisfied with the episode: the British newspapers The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph both reported that ""The End"" received negative reviews and disappointed its viewers.[43][44] Alan Sepinwall of Star-Ledger was less enthusiastic about the finale and stated that he didn't consider the episode to be ""wholly satisfying, either as closure for this season or the series"", highlighting the episode's ""narrative dead ends"" as part of the reason.[45] Mike Hale of The New York Times gave ""The End"" a mixed review, as the episode showed that the series was ""shaky on the big picture"".[46] Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe also gave the episode a mixed review, citing some of the episode's ""quite hokey"" metaphors.[47]David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun gave the episode a highly negative review, describing the final scenes as ""wimpy, phony, quasi-religious, white-light [and] huggy-bear"". He added: ""It looked like [Jack] was walking into a Hollywood wrap party without food or music – just a bunch of actors grinning idiotically for 10 minutes and hugging one another.""[48]Max Read of Gawker was also particularly scathing, calling the finale ""incredibly dumb"" and remarking that ""it ended in the worst way possible"".[49] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode 1½ stars out of 5, saying that many fans would wish ""for a time slip that would give them those 2½ hours and possibly six seasons back"".[50] M.L. House of TV Fanatic felt ""bored"" and ""especially disappointed"" by the finale, and that the show's resolution was ""overarching"".[51] Peter Mucha of The Philadelphia Inquirer also spoke negatively of the finale, calling the series ""one of TV's longest, lamest cons.""[52] Laura Miller of Salon.com suggested that the finale episode was a failure because of its fan base, calling the series ""the quintessential example of a pop masterpiece ruined by its own fans.""[53] Outside the US, the episode also prompted a polarized response. The BBC's Entertainment reporter Kev Geoghegan felt that the episode was ""emotionally satisfying"" and that ""the show was wrapped up rather nicely"".[54] Michael Deacon in The Daily Telegraph was ""beatifically surprised"" at the ""great"" ending.[55] Shane Hegarty in The Irish Times felt that the final scene was ""somewhat of a letdown"", comparing it to the recent similar ending of Ashes to Ashes and contrasting it with the last ever episode of The Sopranos. He remarked: ""[The Sopranos] was not about mystery, but its final scene was so inscrutable that fans are still squinting in an effort to figure it out. Lost's finale, though, was not too obtuse.""[56] Some reviewers ended puzzled about the meaning of Lost. Tim Teeman in The Times referred to ""a global scratching of heads"" in his review but concluded ""The questions are ceaseless: it may be healthier, as one online fan put it, 'to just accept it and move on'"".[57] Steve Busfield and Richard Vine of The Guardian spoke positively about the episode, saying that the series would ""continue to baffle, infuriate and delight fans for an eternity"".[43] Conversely, the TV critic Charlie Brooker, also writing for The Guardian, remarked that ""The End""'s plot ""made less sense than a milk hammock"",[58] while the comedian Danny Baker called the episode ""an outrage"".[5] Reception of the episode, as well as later seasons of Lost on a whole, grew more negative over time to the point of infamy, regularly being considered one of the worst series finales ever.[3][4][5] Chris E.
